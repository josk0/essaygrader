         "Let me analyze this essay based on the given rubric and guidelines:\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nThe thesis appears to be articulated in this paragraph:\n\n> \"Within this essay we will explore how data science products were once utilitarian models; they serve as material anchors in the postmodern landscape that perpetuate systems of oppression through the creation, maintenance, and augmentation of power.\"\n\nThis is a somewhat clear thesis that attempts to answer the question by affirming that data science products can be material anchors supporting racism. However, the thesis could be more explicitly stated and decisively phrased. The student adds some qualifiers like \"were once utilitarian models\" which slightly muddies the clarity of their position.\n\nLater, the student reframes their argument:\n> \"Within this framework of understanding and the case studies we have analyzed, we can see that AI models fall directly within the postmodern framework... Continued innovation in the field of Data Science continues to serve as a mechanism for gaining and maintaining power.\"\n\nThe thesis seems to be that data science products act as material anchors that support racism by maintaining and augmenting power structures within a postmodernist framework. While present, the thesis could be more concisely and decisively stated.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good** - Thesis is present but could be more explicitly stated.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nThe student structures their argument as follows:\n\n1. They define material anchors as \"devices used to stabilize a structure,\" positioning data science models as devices that uphold systems of oppression.\n2. They frame their analysis within postmodernism, highlighting Lyotard's perspective that technological developments \"continue to serve the status quo and the maintenance of [power].\"\n3. They provide case studies (St. George's Hospital Medical School and COMPAS) to demonstrate how AI models perpetuate bias.\n4. They argue that these biases stem from \"decades of racially skewed data\" and that correction is difficult because powerful groups benefit from the status quo.\n5. They conclude that AI models support racism by maintaining power structures.\n\nKey quotes supporting their premises:\n> \"Jean-Francios Lyotard, who is regarded as the first philosopher to use the term 'Postmodernism' said in his book The Postmodern Condition 'In the discourse of today's financial backers of research, the only credible goal is power. Scientists, technicians, and instruments are purchased not to find truth, but to augment power.'\"\n\n> \"ProPublica found that this specific program misclassified black defendants as high risk for recidivism twice as much as their white counterparts, and were 77% more likely to be assigned higher risk scores.\"\n\n> \"As this data is recorded, it perpetuates a cycle of these activities and therefore using already flawed data to create models will always, even with careful formulation, create flawed models.\"\n\nThe premises of the argument are mostly explicit, though there are some gaps in the logical flow. The student establishes that AI models can perpetuate bias (through case studies) and that this bias maintains existing power structures (via postmodernist theory). However, they don't fully develop the explicit connection between \"material anchors\" and racism beyond asserting that these technologies stabilize oppressive systems.\n\nThere is a normative premise about power structures and their role in perpetuating racism, but it could be more fully articulated. The conclusion follows reasonably from the premises, though the logical connections could be strengthened.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good** - Most premises are explicit, though some connections could be more clearly established.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nThe student references Lyotard's postmodernist framework and accurately represents his view that technological developments serve to augment power rather than find truth:\n\n> \"Jean-Francios Lyotard... said in his book The Postmodern Condition 'In the discourse of today's financial backers of research, the only credible goal is power. Scientists, technicians, and instruments are purchased not to find truth, but to augment power.'\"\n\nThey also correctly describe the COMPAS system and the ProPublica findings:\n\n> \"ProPublica found that this specific program misclassified black defendants as high risk for recidivism twice as much as their white counterparts, and were 77% more likely to be assigned higher risk scores.\"\n\nThe student shows a reasonable understanding of postmodernist critique and its application to data science. However, there are some areas where deeper understanding could be demonstrated:\n\n1. The concept of \"material anchors\" is briefly defined but could be more thoroughly explained in relation to philosophical literature.\n2. The discussion of Northpointe's theories (Social Strain theory and Control/Restraint theory) is reasonably accurate but could benefit from more nuanced analysis.\n\nThe student uses their own words to summarize concepts and provides examples to illustrate their points. There are no major misinterpretations, though some concepts could be developed more fully.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good** - Generally accurate summaries with some conceptual areas that could be deepened.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nThe essay has a logical structure:\n1. Introduction and thesis\n2. Definition of key terms\n3. Theoretical framework (postmodernism)\n4. Case studies (St. George's Hospital, COMPAS)\n5. Analysis of why these biases persist\n6. Conclusion\n\nThe student breaks down the problem into appropriate parts, focusing on:\n- Defining material anchors and postmodernism\n- Examining specific case studies\n- Analyzing systemic factors that perpetuate bias\n\nKey quotes demonstrating their analysis:\n> \"Many of the issues we see within racial injustices in data science stem from decades of racially skewed data from over policing, to disproportionate rates of arrest, and decades of racial profiling.\"\n\n> \"Even if we assume this data can be perfected so that it doesn't lead to inequitable outcomes, would people want to? The status quo powers... rely on the maintenance of their status as a hegemonic power or entity.\"\n\nThe analysis shows reasonable depth in examining how data science products perpetuate racism, particularly through the lens of postmodernism and power. However, the essay could benefit from:\n1. More balanced analysis of counter-arguments\n2. Greater conceptual clarity around \"material anchors\"\n3. More consistent focus on the main thesis throughout\n\nThe writing style has some issues with clarity, including typos and awkward phrasing (e.g., \"As Data Science grew in prominence and practice throughout the 20th century, y, so did the demand for Data Scientists and Analysts\"). These minor issues occasionally distract from the content.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good** - Reasonable breakdown of the problem with some areas analyzed more thoroughly than others.\n\n## Main Argument\n\nThe main argument is that data science products function as material anchors that support racism by maintaining and augmenting existing power structures within a postmodernist framework.\n\n## Supporting Points\n\n1. Data science models perpetuate bias by using historically biased data (exemplified by case studies).\n2. Technological innovations serve to maintain and augment power rather than to discover truth (drawing on Lyotard's postmodernism).\n3. Even when biases are identified, they are difficult to correct because maintaining these biases benefits those in power.\n4. Algorithms like COMPAS disproportionately impact marginalized communities by incorporating factors correlated with race and socioeconomic status.\n5. The cycle of biased data collection and model training creates a self-reinforcing system that maintains racial inequities.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\nThe student's argument about data science products perpetuating racism through biased algorithms is supported by appropriate case studies. The evidence from ProPublica regarding COMPAS is particularly relevant and well-incorporated.\n\nThe connection to postmodernism is interesting, though it could be more fully developed. The student invokes Lyotard's critique of technology as serving power, but the development of this theoretical framework throughout the essay is somewhat inconsistent.\n\nThe discussion of \"material anchors\" is conceptually underdeveloped. While the student defines material anchors as \"devices used to stabilize a structure,\" they don't fully explore the philosophical implications of this metaphor or substantially integrate it into their analysis of the case studies.\n\nThe argument about the difficulty of correcting biases due to power structures has merit but could be strengthened with more specific examples or theoretical support. The student asserts that \"hegemonic entities have to be willing to give up some of their power in the name of justice,\" but doesn't fully explore the mechanisms by which this might occur or be resisted.\n\n## Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nThe essay has a clear structure, progressing from definitions to case studies to analysis. The language is generally clear, though there are occasional typos and awkward phrasings.\n\nThe examples (St. George's Hospital and COMPAS) are well-chosen and relevant to the thesis. The student effectively uses these case studies to illustrate how data science products can perpetuate racial bias.\n\nThe focus on the question is reasonably maintained throughout, though the connection to \"material anchors\" wanes in the middle sections before being reintroduced in the conclusion.\n\n## Addressing the Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the question \"Can Data Science products be material anchors that support Racism?\" The student answers in the affirmative and provides a framework for understanding how this occurs through power dynamics and biased algorithms.\n\nHowever, the concept of \"material anchors\" could be more fully integrated throughout the essay to strengthen the connection to the question. The student defines the term but doesn't consistently relate their examples and analysis back to this concept.\n\nOverall, the essay addresses the assigned question but could more thoroughly develop some key concepts and strengthen logical connections."

         "Let me begin by analyzing this essay according to the rubric and guidelines provided.\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nRelevant quotes:\n- \"I argue that while advocates fofor recidivism risk assessment tools claim them to be objbjective and neutral predictors, in reality, y, these tools oftften encode human bias and perprpetutuate or even amplify fy inequalities; these models do not reflflect objbjective reality, y, but instead reflflect historic inequities and flflawed data.\"\n- \"It is clear that data science has the potential to be a positive tool in the criminal justice system, if used corrrrectly. However, this oftften is not the case, and currrrent recidivism risk assessment tools as whole are not objbjective.\"\n\nThe essay does contain a clearly stated thesis that directly answers the question about whether recidivism risk assessment tools are objective. The student takes a clear position: these tools are not objective because they encode human bias and perpetuate inequalities. The thesis appears in the introduction and is reinforced in the conclusion.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent - The thesis is clearly stated and decisively answers the question posed.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nRelevant quotes:\n- \"Though as Ludwig and Mullainathan emphasize, an algorithm's recommendation can only be as accurate as the data it is trained on. In reality, y, data is flflawed or incomplete in some way in nearly every ry apapplication, guaranteeing some level of errrror.\"\n- \"However, the questionnaire goes fufurther into the individudual's background and fafamily historyry. Those frfrom a privileged background would not have the same experiences to document as someone frfrom a lower socio-economic statutus or a minority, y, likely resulting in a prediction of lower risk.\"\n- \"A well-designed algorithm drastically improves consistency of rurulings, both between judges and the consistency of the same judge. However, even a fafair algorithm's interactions with flflawed data will produduce flflawed results.\"\n\nThe essay's argument has explicitly stated premises that connect to its conclusion. The main premise is that algorithms rely on data that reflects historical biases and inequalities in the criminal justice system. The student connects this to the conclusion that these tools cannot be objective since they perpetuate these biases. The student also acknowledges counterarguments by noting that algorithms themselves may not be inherently biased, but their implementation with flawed data leads to biased outcomes.\n\nThe logical flow is generally sound, connecting the problems with data collection, proxy variables for race and class, and feedback loops in policing to show how recidivism risk assessment tools encode and perpetuate bias rather than being objective.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - Most premises are explicit with a clear connection to the conclusion, though there could be more development of some normative premises around what constitutes \"objectivity.\"\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nRelevant quotes:\n- \"Ludwig and Mullainathan, in their article FrFragile Alglgoriththms and FaFallible DecisisionMaMakekersrs, show that these algorithms, w hile achieving their goal of consistency, y, did not achieve the desired accuracy rates.\"\n- \"Cathy O'Neil details the ways in which algorithms tend to positively cater to already-privileged individuduals while exacerbrbating discrimination and prejejudice among minorities and disadvantaged groupups in her text, WeWeapapons of of MaMath th Destruction.\"\n- \"O'Neil highlights that some states only use these predictive scores to evaluate which inmates should be prioritized fofor anti-recidivism projojects, and the models do not impact sentencing or parole.\"\n\nThe essay references and summarizes two key texts: Ludwig and Mullainathan's \"Fragile Algorithms and Fallible Decision Makers\" and Cathy O'Neil's \"Weapons of Math Destruction.\" The summaries appear accurate and are presented in the student's own words, without excessive quotation. The student correctly captures key arguments from these sources, such as how algorithms encode bias, how they may achieve consistency but not accuracy, and how they can disproportionately impact disadvantaged groups.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent - Referenced texts are accurately summarized in the student's own words with no apparent misinterpretations.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nRelevant quotes:\n- \"Since its inception, the United States criminal court system has been criticized fofor its unfafair practices pertaining to various protected classes such as race. In many ways, this system has perprpetutuated inequalities and disparities across groupups through its ruruling decisions.\"\n- \"There is an imbalance in policing of rich versus poorer neighborhrhoods and a statistical inequality in the individuduals police choose to stop fofor questioning; O'Neil highlights a 2013 stutudy that fofound that though Black and Latino males aged 14-24 made up up less than 5% of the New YoYork City population, they accounted fofor over 40% of stop-and-frfrisk searches by police.\"\n- \"Until risk assessment tools no longer perprpetutuate discrimination, they should be used sparingly in the legal system; O'Neil highlights that some states only use these predictive scores to evaluate which inmates should be prioritized fofor anti-recidivism projojects, and the models do not impact sentencing or parole.\"\n\nThe essay is structured with clear sections: an introduction stating the thesis, a section on \"Designed Discrimination\" analyzing how bias enters these tools, and a conclusion summarizing the argument and offering recommendations. The problem is broken down into suitable parts: the limitations of human judgment, the technical challenges of algorithm development, the socio-technical gap, the role of biased data, and the feedback loops that perpetuate inequality.\n\nThe analysis is focused and at an appropriate level of detail. The student uses specific examples, such as the LSI-R assessment tool and the NYC stop-and-frisk statistics, to illustrate broader points about bias in risk assessment tools.\n\nHowever, there are numerous typographical errors throughout the essay (e.g., \"fofor\" instead of \"for\", \"objbjective\" instead of \"objective\") that somewhat impact clarity. These appear to be formatting or transcription errors rather than the student's writing, but they do affect readability.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - The problem is broken down into appropriate parts with a focused analysis, though the typographical errors impact clarity.\n\n## Main Argument\n\nThe main argument of the essay is that recidivism risk assessment tools are not objective because they are trained on data that reflects historical biases and inequalities in the criminal justice system, and as a result, they perpetuate or even amplify these inequalities rather than providing neutral predictions.\n\n## Supporting Points\n\n1. Data used to train these algorithms is incomplete and reflects existing biases in policing and criminal justice (e.g., disproportionate policing of poor neighborhoods and minorities).\n\n2. Questions in assessment tools like LSI-R contain proxy variables for race and class, resulting in different risk scores for similar individuals based on their socioeconomic background.\n\n3. Even well-designed algorithms interact with flawed data to produce biased results, creating a feedback loop that reinforces existing inequalities.\n\n4. When implemented in sentencing or parole decisions, these biased risk scores can have significant real-world impacts on individuals' lives, particularly those from marginalized communities.\n\n5. While the technology has potential, current implementations are ethically problematic and should be used sparingly until significant improvements are made.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\nThe essay's central argument about algorithms encoding and amplifying bias through flawed data is logically sound and well-supported. The student effectively demonstrates how seemingly neutral questions in risk assessment tools can function as proxies for race and class, showing a sophisticated understanding of how indirect discrimination can occur.\n\nThe essay acknowledges counterarguments, noting that \"advocates for recidivism risk models suggest that they are not inherently biased, and I generally agree with this statement.\" This shows nuance in the student's thinking. The student concedes that algorithms themselves may be neutral but argues that their interaction with biased data and the real-world context means they cannot be considered objective in practice.\n\nOne weakness is that the essay could more explicitly define \"objectivity\" to strengthen its normative claims. What would a truly objective risk assessment tool look like? Is objectivity even possible in this context? These questions are implied but not fully addressed.\n\nThe analysis of how these tools create feedback loops is particularly strong, showing how initial bias leads to more policing in certain areas, which leads to more arrests, which reinforces the algorithm's association between those neighborhoods and higher risk.\n\n## Structure, Language, Use of Examples, and Focus\n\nThe essay has a clear structure with an introduction, two main sections, and a conclusion. It stays focused on the central question of objectivity in recidivism risk assessment tools.\n\nThe language is generally clear and precise, though there are numerous typographical errors (likely due to transcription issues rather than the student's writing).\n\nThe student effectively uses examples to illustrate theoretical points, particularly in discussing the LSI-R assessment tool and citing specific statistics about policing disparities. These examples strengthen the argument by connecting abstract concerns about bias to concrete practices.\n\nThe essay maintains focus throughout, consistently relating its analysis back to the central question of objectivity. It avoids tangents and each paragraph builds toward the overall argument.\n\n## Addressing the Assigned Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the assigned question: \"Data-driven tools for recidivism risk assessment operationalize recidivism as 'a new arrest within two years.' Proponents of such tools claim that such risk assessment tools are objective. Are they?\"\n\nThe student takes a clear position (these tools are not objective) and provides a substantive analysis of why, considering both the technical aspects of algorithms and the social context in which they operate. The essay goes beyond a simple yes/no answer to provide a nuanced analysis of the limitations of these tools and the conditions under which they might become more objective.\n\nOverall, this is a strong essay that demonstrates critical thinking, engagement with relevant sources, and a sophisticated understanding of the ethical challenges posed by algorithmic decision-making in the criminal justice system. The main weaknesses are the typographical errors affecting clarity and the lack of a more explicit definition of objectivity as a normative standard."

         "Let me carefully analyze this essay based on the provided rubric and guidelines.\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nKey quotes related to thesis:\n- \"This final recommendation will be to apply the definition of separation, which requires equal false and true positive rates across groups. This definition allows for a balance to be attained where a company can focus on diverse hiring practices, while still ensuring that each new employee hired will have the optimal probability to continue on successfully in the company.\"\n- \"In conclusion, out of the three definitions of fairness, I decided separation was the most fitting for the task at hand.\"\n\nThe essay has a clear and decisive thesis - it argues that the definition of fairness as \"separation\" is the most appropriate for the company to use in its ML-based resume screening system. The thesis directly answers the question and takes a clear position. The author states this thesis explicitly both in the introduction and reiterates it in the conclusion.\n\nAssessment: Excellent\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nKey quotes:\n- \"Where independence can have too strong of a hand in undoing historical bias, and sufffficiency has the legitimate possibility of perpetuating it, this definition strikes a perfect balance.\"\n- \"This isn't to say that this is perfect for building a machine learning system - this definition is rather data-intensive, as one must keep careful track of the various rates, monitoring individuals for their success, in order to create a continuously successful system.\"\n- \"While this definition seems to be a stronger option than independence, because it results in an objective measure for an individual's likelihood for success, I opted against it for the potential to limit perspectives and representation from marginalized groups.\"\n\nThe essay establishes premises that:\n1. The company needs a fair ML system for resume screening\n2. There are three main definitions of fairness: independence, sufficiency, and separation\n3. Independence focuses on equal hiring rates across protected groups\n4. Sufficiency focuses on equal risk scores across groups\n5. Separation focuses on equal error rates across groups\n6. Independence can \"overcorrect\" and potentially hire less qualified candidates\n7. Sufficiency can perpetuate historical biases\n8. Separation balances diversity with performance prediction\n\nThe essay connects these premises to support its conclusion that separation is the best definition. It explicitly addresses potential counterarguments and drawbacks (e.g., data intensiveness of separation). The normative premise that fairness should both combat historical bias without sacrificing predictive accuracy is present.\n\nThere are no obvious logical fallacies, though the essay could have given more explicit reasons why the company should value diversity (rather than just assuming this is important).\n\nAssessment: Good to Excellent\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nKey quotes:\n- \"These distinct definitions of fairness have been termed 1) independence, 2) separation, and 3) sufffficiency.\"\n- \"This definition of fairness is given as ensuring equal hiring rates across difffferent protected groups, done by making the protected characteristic 'independent' of the data used by the machine to generate a prediction.\"\n- \"This definition of fairness has to do with equalized risk rates, seeking to create a machine-learning system that gives each potential employee a score.\"\n\nThe essay demonstrates a solid understanding of the three definitions of fairness from Barocas' \"Fairness and Machine Learning\" (though it doesn't explicitly cite this source). The student accurately summarizes each definition in their own words and demonstrates understanding of the key concepts like redundant encodings, false positive rates, and base rates.\n\nOne minor issue is that there appear to be some typos with extra letters in words like \"difffferent\" and \"sufffficiency\" throughout the essay, which could be due to formatting issues during submission.\n\nAssessment: Good to Excellent\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nKey quotes:\n- \"For a company that seeks to optimize its résumé screening process and use machine learning to predict a potential employee's success, fairness is key to address in creating this machine learning system.\"\n- \"In the course of this essay, y, I will evaluate each definition for its pros and cons in this scenario, before settling on my ultimate recommendation.\"\n- \"First, I will discuss independence... Next, I will evaluate the definition of fairness termed sufffficiency... Finally, y, I will speak on the definition of fairness known as separation.\"\n\nThe essay follows a clear and logical structure:\n1. Introduction with thesis\n2. Analysis of independence (definition, pros, cons)\n3. Analysis of sufficiency (definition, pros, cons)\n4. Analysis of separation (definition, pros, cons)\n5. Conclusion restating the thesis and summarizing arguments\n\nThe essay breaks down the problem into appropriate parts (the three definitions of fairness) and analyzes each one with a comparable level of detail. The student maintains focus on the central question and keeps the analysis directed toward addressing which definition the company should use.\n\nThere are some minor clarity issues with occasional typos and odd phrasing (e.g., \"y,\" appears a few times), but overall the structure is very clear and the analysis is focused.\n\nAssessment: Good to Excellent\n\n## Main Argument\nThe main argument of the essay is that the definition of fairness as \"separation\" (equal false positive and false negative rates across protected groups) is the most appropriate for a company using ML for resume screening because it balances the need for diverse hiring with the need for accurate prediction of employee success.\n\n## Supporting Points\n1. Independence can lead to \"overcorrection\" that sacrifices accuracy for demographic parity, potentially resulting in hiring less qualified candidates.\n2. Sufficiency maintains accuracy but does nothing to combat historical biases, potentially resulting in a less diverse workforce.\n3. Separation achieves a balance by focusing on equal error rates across groups, which can combat bias without sacrificing too much predictive accuracy.\n4. Separation focuses on outcomes (error rates) rather than just representation or scores, which provides a practical metric for fairness.\n5. While separation requires more careful data tracking, this disadvantage is outweighed by its benefits in balancing diversity and accuracy.\n\n## Critical Examination\nThe essay presents valid arguments about the trade-offs between the three definitions of fairness. It correctly identifies that independence can lead to less accurate predictions if base rates differ between groups, and that sufficiency does not address historical biases. The argument for separation as a \"perfect balance\" is reasonably well-supported, though the essay could have been more explicit about why diversity is desirable for the company (e.g., diverse perspectives lead to better products, avoiding legal issues with discriminatory hiring).\n\nThe essay acknowledges a drawback of separation (data intensiveness) but does not deeply explore potential counterarguments against its position. For example, it doesn't address potential scenarios where separation might not be the best choice, or situations where the additional data requirements might make it impractical.\n\n## Structure, Language, Examples\nThe essay has a clear and logical structure that follows a standard format: introduction with thesis, body paragraphs examining each definition, and conclusion. The language is generally clear, though there are some typos and awkward phrasings.\n\nThe essay could have benefited from more concrete examples. While it explains the concepts of false positives and false negatives in the context of resume screening, it doesn't provide specific scenarios or hypothetical cases that would illustrate how the different fairness definitions would play out in practice.\n\n## Addressing the Question\nThe essay directly addresses the assigned question, which asks what definition of fairness a company should use for ML-based resume screening and why. The student takes a clear position and provides reasoned arguments for their choice.\n\nThe essay meets the requirements of the assignment by:\n1. Clearly stating which definition of fairness the company should use\n2. Explaining why this definition is appropriate for the context\n3. Considering alternative definitions and their shortcomings\n4. Acknowledging potential drawbacks of the recommended approach\n\nThe word count appears to be within the 1500-word limit based on the essay's length."

         "# Overall Essay Analysis\n\nLet me analyze this student essay on whether data science products can be \"material anchors\" that support racism.\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nKey quotes related to thesis:\n- \"For this essay, overall use of motion sensors and cameras and how the limited \"thinking\" they are allowed, while making some people uncomfortable, is a constraint of technology and projection of larger issues rather than an act of mechanized racism.\"\n- \"These limited thought, \"dumb\" data science products often fall under misuse or insufficient data but to say these material anchors support racism is far from fact.\"\n\nThe thesis appears to be that simple data science products (like motion sensors and cameras) aren't actively racist but rather have technological limitations that some people interpret as racism. The student argues these are not \"material anchors\" supporting racism but rather imperfect tools where people project racial issues onto them.\n\nThis thesis is stated in the introduction and reiterated in the conclusion, but it could be more precisely articulated. The thesis answers the question posed in the title but could be more explicitly framed in terms of the philosophical concept of \"material anchors\" that seems to be central to the assignment.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good** - The thesis is present but could be more explicitly connected to the philosophical framework of \"material anchors\" and stated more concisely.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nKey premises of the argument:\n1. \"Most sensor products fill the role of a very basic function – has X changed in relation to Y. [...] If for any reason the sensor cannot reflect, then it cannot function.\"\n2. \"Products that require limited and low data entries run with only so much purview and power. They are not making racist decisions on the spot each time they are operated in a new scenario simply because they lack the ability to do so.\"\n3. \"Data science products are always evolving – new data is being created and used... these products, these material anchors, are nothing more than tools that have emotions, feelings, and labels thrusted onto them when they don't work accurately.\"\n\nThe argument's conclusion:\n- Simple data science products have technological limitations rather than racist intentions; people project racism onto them when they malfunction.\n\nThe essay attempts to build a logical argument by explaining how basic data science products function and why they might fail with darker skin. However, several key premises are missing:\n- No clear definition of what constitutes a \"material anchor\" for racism\n- Little engagement with philosophical concepts of how material objects can perpetuate social structures\n- Missing normative premise explaining why intention matters more than impact in defining racism\n\nThe essay uses examples of soap dispensers and cameras to illustrate technical limitations, but doesn't fully connect these to a philosophical framework about material anchors. The conclusion follows somewhat from the stated premises, but there are significant gaps in the reasoning.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Needs Improvement** - Several major premises are missing, particularly around philosophical concepts central to the question. The connection between technical explanations and the conclusion about racism is not fully developed.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nKey quotes demonstrating understanding:\n- \"As referenced by Liao and Huebner, a black man recorded, with a humorous perspective, a soap dispenser that did not dispense for him but did for his white friend.\"\n- \"Liao and Huebner think that any data science product that cause such feelings as mentioned above, ones that perpetuate behaviors, associations, or feelings with negativity due to psychological judgments, are rooting in racism and help reinforce racist norm in society.\"\n\nThe essay references Liao and Huebner's work and attempts to summarize their position. However, the summary is quite brief and lacks specificity. The essay doesn't unpack the philosophical concept of \"material anchors\" in depth. It refers to some examples cited by these authors but doesn't fully explain their theoretical framework or arguments.\n\nThe essay relies on its own interpretations rather than clearly distinguishing between the authors' views and the student's response. There is almost no direct quotation, which is good, but the paraphrasing of the original arguments seems thin and potentially misrepresents the complexity of the source material.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Needs Improvement** - There appears to be some misunderstanding of the philosophical concept of \"material anchors\" and insufficient engagement with the source material. The authors' views are summarized very briefly without much depth.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nStructure:\nThe essay is organized into sections with headings: introduction, \"The Culprits,\" \"Caught in the Act?\", \"Err on the Side of Error,\" and \"Let's Recap.\" This provides a clear structure, but the logical flow between sections is sometimes unclear.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe essay attempts to break down the problem by:\n1. Distinguishing between \"smart\" AI and \"dumb\" sensor technologies\n2. Analyzing how basic sensors work\n3. Examining cases of potential technological racism with soap dispensers and cameras\n4. Arguing that technical limitations rather than racism explain these failures\n\nHowever, the essay doesn't delve deeply into the philosophical question of how material objects can embody or perpetuate social structures regardless of intention. The analysis of the examples is primarily technical rather than philosophical.\n\nLanguage and Clarity:\nThe essay generally uses clear language but sometimes becomes repetitive. For example, multiple paragraphs restate the idea that these products have technical limitations rather than racist intentions.\n\nExamples:\nThe essay cites examples of soap dispensers and cameras, but these examples are not developed in great detail. The essay doesn't provide enough context about the philosophical debate around material anchors to fully analyze these examples.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Needs Improvement** - The essay has a basic structure but doesn't break down the philosophical problem adequately. The analysis focuses too narrowly on technical aspects rather than engaging with the philosophical concept of material anchors.\n\n## Main Argument and Supporting Points\n\nMain argument: Simple data science products like motion sensors and cameras have technical limitations that cause them to fail with darker skin, but these failures stem from technical constraints rather than racism, and people are projecting racism onto these devices.\n\nSupporting points:\n1. Basic sensors operate on simple binary logic without the ability to make complex discriminatory decisions\n2. Technical explanations (like infrared absorption by darker skin) explain failures rather than racist design\n3. People who have experienced racism may be projecting past negative experiences onto these technical failures\n4. These products could be improved with better data, suggesting the issue is technical inadequacy not racist intent\n5. The notion that these devices are \"material anchors\" for racism overstates their social significance\n\nCritical examination:\n- The essay's focus on the lack of racist intention in these devices misses the point about how material objects can perpetuate inequalities regardless of intent\n- The argument downplays the real experiences of those affected by suggesting they are \"projecting\" rather than experiencing genuine discrimination\n- The technical explanations are presented without evidence or deep technical understanding\n- The argument doesn't fully engage with the philosophical concept of \"material anchors\" that seems central to the question\n- There's a logical inconsistency in acknowledging technical limitations while dismissing their social impact\n\nThe essay's focus on the question of whether these devices are intentionally racist rather than whether they function as material anchors for racism suggests the student may have misunderstood the philosophical framework of the question.\n\n## Addressing the Assigned Question\n\nThe essay addresses the question of whether data science products can be \"material anchors\" that support racism, but it seems to misinterpret what \"material anchors\" means in this philosophical context. Instead of engaging with how material objects can perpetuate social structures regardless of intention, the essay focuses narrowly on whether these devices have racist intentions or whether people are projecting racism onto them.\n\nThe essay doesn't adequately engage with the philosophical literature on material anchors or embodied cognition that would be necessary to fully address the question. The focus on intentionality rather than impact suggests a misunderstanding of the core philosophical concept.\n\nOverall, while the essay does attempt to answer the assigned question, it doesn't demonstrate a strong grasp of the philosophical framework needed to fully address it.\n\n## Overall Assessment\n\nThe essay demonstrates some effort to engage with the question and provides a structured response with examples. However, it has several significant weaknesses:\n\n1. Limited engagement with the philosophical concept of \"material anchors\"\n2. Focus on intentionality rather than structural impact of technologies\n3. Dismissal of lived experiences as \"projection\"\n4. Insufficient analysis of the philosophical arguments in the source material\n5. Overreliance on technical explanations without sufficient evidence\n\nThe essay would benefit from a deeper understanding of how material objects can perpetuate social structures regardless of intention, more engagement with the philosophical literature, and a more nuanced analysis that doesn't dismiss the experiences of those affected by technological failures."

Specifically, the company should aim to ensure that protected attributes like race, gender, and age do not directly cause disparities in candidates' chances of being selected.\"\n\nThe thesis takes a definitive position on what definition of fairness the company should adopt and provides a clear rationale. The student restates the thesis in the conclusion, maintaining consistency throughout the essay.",
         "## Argument Validity\nThe essay constructs a valid argument with explicit premises that logically lead to the conclusion. Key premises include:\n\n- Statistical fairness metrics (equalized odds and predictive parity) are mathematically incompatible when base rates differ\n- \"The causal approach to fairness can be defined as focusing on whether a protected characteristic has a causal effect on errors or predictive value, beyond its relevance to the task at hand\"\n- \"The ethical foundation of fairness in hiring for this company can rely on the idea that individuals should be assessed based on job-relevant qualifications rather than irrelevant personal attributes\"\n\nThe student anticipates objections (\"One objection for causal fairness is that it requires identifying and controlling for all relevant qualifications, which is practically impossible\") and provides reasoned responses. The conclusion follows logically from the premises without fallacies.",

Predictive parity requires that, for all selected candidates, the likelihood of actual success on the job is equal across groups.\"\n\nThe student accurately explains the mathematical incompatibility of these definitions, citing Beigang (2023). The explanation of causal fairness and matching techniques is clear and in the student's own words.

Also, consider providing more specific details on how causal fairness would be implemented in practice—what specific techniques would the company use to ensure protected attributes don't directly cause disparities?\n\nOverall, this is thoughtful, well-structured work that directly addresses the question with sophisticated analysis. Your ability to anticipate and respond to objections demonstrates mature philosophical thinking.",

         "Let me begin by analyzing this essay according to the rubric criteria, examining key sentences, and evaluating how well the essay meets each criterion.\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nKey sentences related to thesis:\n- \"In this essay, I argue that the company should adopt a causal fairness definition when designing its résumé-screening algorithm. Specifically, the company should aim to ensure that protected attributes like race, gender, and age do not directly cause disparities in candidates' chances of being selected.\"\n- \"This causal approach avoids the consequences of statistical fairness metrics and offers an ethically defensible, context-specific path to fairness that aligns with the company's goal of building a workforce where hiring decisions are driven by job-relevant qualifications, not by other characteristics.\"\n- \"In this essay, I have argued that the company should adopt causal fairness as its guiding definition when developing its résumé-screening algorithm.\"\n\nThe thesis is clearly stated in the first paragraph and restated in the conclusion. The student takes a decisive position by advocating for the causal fairness approach over statistical fairness metrics. The thesis directly answers the question about what definition of fairness the company should adopt and provides a clear rationale.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nKey premises of the argument:\n- \"Fairness in algorithmic decision-making refers to the just and equitable treatment of individuals or groups in the selection process.\"\n- \"Many definitions of fairness exist, but two dominant statistical approaches have emerged: equalized odds and predictive parity.\"\n- \"Beigang (2023) has argued that both definitions are mathematically incompatible when different groups have different base rates of success.\"\n- \"The causal approach to fairness can be defined as focusing on whether a protected characteristic (race, gender, etc.) has a causal effect on errors or predictive value, beyond its relevance to the task at hand.\"\n- \"The ethical foundation of fairness in hiring for this company can rely on the idea that individuals should be assessed based on job-relevant qualifications rather than irrelevant personal attributes like race, gender, or age.\"\n\nThe student explicitly states the key premises of their argument and shows how these premises connect to their conclusion that causal fairness is the best approach. They acknowledge potential objections to the causal approach (\"One objection for causal fairness is that it requires identifying and controlling for all relevant qualifications, which is practically impossible\") and provide responses to these objections. The conclusion follows logically from the premises, and the student avoids obvious fallacies.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nKey sentences demonstrating understanding:\n- \"Equalized odds requires that error rates -- false positives and false negatives -- be equal across protected groups. Predictive parity requires that, for all selected candidates, the likelihood of actual success on the job is equal across groups.\"\n- \"Beigang (2023) has argued that both definitions are mathematically incompatible when different groups have different base rates of success.\"\n- \"Further, Beigang's analysis reveals that statistical fairness criteria overreach by requiring parity in outcomes rather than ensuring that decision processes are not directly biased.\"\n\nThe student accurately summarizes key concepts of fairness in algorithmic decision-making, including equalized odds and predictive parity. They reference Beigang (2023) to support their discussion of the incompatibility of different fairness definitions. The summaries are in the student's own words, with minimal direct quotation. The explanations of causal fairness and matching techniques show a solid understanding of these concepts.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good to Excellent\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nKey sentences demonstrating analysis and structure:\n- \"Fairness, in this context, can have multiple definitions, thus, complicating which definition and approach should be used.\"\n- \"The issue with these definitions and approaches is they are unable to coexist.\"\n- \"Consider the résumé screening system the company wants to use for this example. Suppose two candidates, one male and one female, have identical degrees, work experience, and skills.\"\n- \"One objection for causal fairness is that it requires identifying and controlling for all relevant qualifications, which is practically impossible.\"\n\nThe essay has a clear structure with an introduction that presents the thesis, sections that define and defend the causal approach to fairness, examples to illustrate the approach, consideration of objections, and a conclusion. The student breaks down the problem into suitable parts: defining fairness, examining statistical approaches and their limitations, introducing causal fairness, defending this approach, illustrating with examples, addressing objections, and concluding. The essay maintains focus throughout and provides appropriate detail.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent\n\n## Main Argument\n\nThe main argument of the essay is that a company using ML for resume screening should adopt a causal fairness definition rather than statistical fairness metrics (like equalized odds or predictive parity). The causal approach focuses on ensuring that protected attributes do not directly cause disparities in candidates' chances of being selected, which better aligns with the ethical principle that hiring decisions should be based on job-relevant qualifications rather than personal characteristics.\n\n## Supporting Points\n\n1. Statistical fairness definitions (equalized odds and predictive parity) are mathematically incompatible when different groups have different base rates of success, making it impossible to satisfy both simultaneously.\n\n2. The causal approach, using matching techniques, can reconcile the trade-off between different fairness definitions by comparing individuals who are similar in all relevant ways except for their protected characteristics.\n\n3. Statistical fairness metrics focus on surface-level disparities rather than examining whether those disparities are causally linked to discrimination, whereas causal fairness isolates the causal influence of protected attributes.\n\n4. The causal approach aligns with the ethical principle that individuals should be assessed based on job-relevant qualifications rather than personal attributes like race or gender.\n\n5. While implementing causal fairness perfectly is challenging, even approximate matching methods offer practical improvements over statistical approaches.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\nThe argument for causal fairness over statistical fairness metrics is generally valid and well-supported. The student correctly identifies the impossibility of satisfying both equalized odds and predictive parity simultaneously when base rates differ. They provide a clear explanation of how the causal approach addresses this issue by focusing on whether protected characteristics directly influence outcomes.\n\nThe student acknowledges limitations of the causal approach, particularly the difficulty of identifying and controlling for all relevant qualifications. Their response to this objection is reasonable, suggesting that imperfect matching can still reduce unfairness. They also address the challenge of measuring qualitative factors that affect job success and happiness, proposing a combined approach using both causal fairness methods and qualitative assessments.\n\nOne potential weakness is that the essay could have provided more detail on how to operationalize causal fairness in practice, particularly how the matching technique would be implemented in an actual resume screening system. Additionally, while the student mentions Beigang (2023), they could have incorporated more sources to strengthen their argument.\n\n## Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear and logical structure with an introduction, main body, and conclusion. The main body is well-organized into sections that define fairness, defend the causal approach, provide examples, address objections, and conclude. This structure helps the reader follow the argument.\n\nLanguage: The essay uses clear, precise language to explain complex concepts like equalized odds, predictive parity, and causal fairness. Technical terms are defined and explained.\n\nExamples: The essay includes a concrete example of how the causal approach would work in practice, comparing male and female candidates with identical qualifications. This example effectively illustrates the concept of causal fairness.\n\nFocus: The essay maintains a clear focus on the question of what definition of fairness the company should adopt. All sections contribute to answering this question, and the student avoids tangential discussions.\n\n## How Well the Essay Addresses the Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the assigned question: \"What definition of fairness should the company take, and why?\" The student clearly states their position (causal fairness) and provides a detailed justification for this choice, comparing it to alternative definitions (equalized odds and predictive parity).\n\nThe essay demonstrates an understanding of the specific context (a company using ML for resume screening) and considers how the fairness definition relates to the company's goals (finding candidates likely to be successful and happy employees). The student also considers practical implementation challenges, which is relevant to the company's decision-making.\n\nOverall, the essay provides a thorough and well-reasoned answer to the question, taking into account both theoretical considerations and practical implications.\n\n## Word Count Considerations\n\nThe essay appears to be within the 1500-word limit. Given this constraint, the student manages to provide a comprehensive treatment of the topic, including definitions, comparison of approaches, defense of their position, examples, and responses to objections.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThis is a strong essay that presents a clear thesis, constructs a valid argument with explicit premises, demonstrates good understanding of the concepts, and maintains a clear structure and focus. The main argument for causal fairness is well-supported and addresses potential objections. The essay directly answers the assigned question and provides a thoughtful analysis of fairness in the context of ML-based resume screening. Minor weaknesses include limited engagement with the literature beyond Beigang (2023) and could have included more detail on practical implementation of causal fairness."

         "Thesis: The essay presents a clear, decisive thesis that directly answers the question of whether recidivism risk assessment tools are objective. The thesis is explicitly stated at the end of the introduction: \"However, a closer examination of the processes behind such algorithms demonstrates that this apparent objectivity is an illusion, and that true objectivity is impossible.\" The position is maintained consistently throughout the essay and reinforced in the conclusion: \"Given that the tool's true outcomes are a reinforcement of biases, and not an accurate reflection of reality, it would be prudent to consider ceasing the use of COMPAS altogether until these issues can be resolved.\"",
         "Argument Validity: The essay constructs a valid argument with explicitly stated premises and a conclusion that follows logically. The main argument is structured as:\n1) A tool can be objective if it does not involve subjective decision-making and human biases\n2) COMPAS involves subjective decisions in its definition of recidivism, measurement of characteristics, and interpretation of fairness\n3) Therefore, COMPAS is not objective\n\nThe essay strengthens its validity by anticipating and addressing counterarguments: \"Supporters of COMPAS who view it as an objective tool might say that the biases incurred by the usage of arrests as a proxy for recidivism is not an attribute of the system itself, but rather an external societal factor.\" The student then offers a rebuttal that reinforces their original argument.",

         "Let me analyze this student essay about the objectivity of data-driven recidivism risk assessment tools based on the rubric criteria.\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nKey quotes:\n- \"However, a closer examination of the processes behind such algorithms demonstrates that this apparent objectivity is an illusion, and that true objectivity is impossible.\"\n- \"Therefore, the criteria for objectivity are not fulfilled and COMPAS is not objective.\"\n- \"Given that the tool's true outcomes are a reinforcement of biases, and not an accurate reflection of reality, it would be prudent to consider ceasing the use of COMPAS altogether until these issues can be resolved.\"\n\nThe essay has a clear thesis that directly answers the question of whether recidivism risk assessment tools are objective. The student takes a decisive position that they are not objective, and explains why. The thesis is explicitly stated at the end of the introduction and reinforced throughout the essay.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent. The thesis clearly answers the question decisively.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nThe main argument structure appears to be:\n1. A tool can be objective if it does not involve subjective decision-making and human biases\n2. If a tool's design allows it to be influenced by human bias or subjective decisions, then it is not objective\n3. COMPAS involves subjective decisions and human biases in:\n   a) Its definition of recidivism\n   b) The measurement of relevant characteristics\n   c) The selected interpretation of fairness\n4. Therefore, COMPAS is not objective\n\nKey quotes:\n- \"Opponents of the claim that COMPAS is objective agree with its proponents that a tool can be objective if it does not involve subjective decision-making and human biases.\"\n- \"There are several points at which subjective decisions were made and human bias bled into the model: its definition of recidivism, the measurement of relevant characteristics, and the selected interpretation of fairness.\"\n- \"Given that the selected proxy for recidivism is affected by human racial biases, that the training data was influenced by subjectivity at every step of its creation, and that the definition of fairness used when developing COMPAS was based on a subjective decision, the initial criteria for objectivity are not fulfilled.\"\n\nThe premises are clearly stated, and the conclusion follows logically from them. The student also anticipates and responds to potential counterarguments, strengthening the validity of their argument. All major premises are made explicit, and the connection between premises and conclusion is clear.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent. All premises are explicitly stated, the conclusion follows logically, and key connections between premises and conclusion are clear.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nThe essay demonstrates understanding of the relevant concepts and literature:\n\nKey quotes:\n- \"As Hardt and Recht described, data about relevant characteristics – those given to the model for its training data – was gathered from defendants via surveys.\"\n- \"Barocas and Boyd contrast two perspectives on the algorithm's fairness: one from a critic who identifies a large discrepancy in error rates between Black and white defendants...\"\n- \"In the United States, 'False arrests' tend to disproportionately affect Black people... as described by Jacobs and Wallach.\"\n\nThe student accurately summarizes key points from referenced texts in their own words. They demonstrate understanding of technical concepts like proxy variables, fairness definitions, and algorithmic bias. The references to authors (Hardt and Recht, Barocas and Boyd, Jacobs and Wallach) suggest familiarity with relevant literature.\n\nThe essay does not rely heavily on direct quotes, instead paraphrasing and integrating the ideas into the student's own argument. There don't appear to be significant misunderstandings of the referenced texts.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good to Excellent. References are accurately summarized in the student's own words, with no apparent misinterpretations. The level of understanding shown is strong, though more detailed engagement with specific arguments from the literature might have improved this to definitively \"Excellent.\"\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nThe essay has a clear structure:\n- Introduction with thesis\n- Argument against objectivity (overview)\n- Detailed examination of key points (recidivism definition, data collection, fairness interpretations)\n- Counterarguments and responses\n- Conclusion\n\nKey quotes on structure:\n- \"There are several points at which subjective decisions were made and human bias bled into the model: its definition of recidivism, the measurement of relevant characteristics, and the selected interpretation of fairness.\"\n- \"Given that the selected proxy for recidivism is affected by human racial biases, that the training data was influenced by subjectivity at every step of its creation, and that the definition of fairness used when developing COMPAS was based on a subjective decision, the initial criteria for objectivity are not fulfilled.\"\n\nThe problem is broken down into appropriate components, with each receiving focused analysis. The student identifies three key points where objectivity is compromised and analyzes each in turn. The level of detail is appropriate for the word limit, and the analysis is focused on the central question of objectivity.\n\nThe essay also considers potential counterarguments, demonstrating sophisticated analysis:\n- \"Supporters of COMPAS who view it as an objective tool might say that the biases incurred by the usage of arrests as a proxy for recidivism is not an attribute of the system itself, but rather an external societal factor.\"\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent. The problem is effectively broken down into suitable parts, with appropriate level of detail and focused analysis. Counterarguments are addressed, showing depth of thinking.\n\n## Supporting Points for Main Argument:\n\n1. Recidivism is defined as \"a new arrest within two years,\" which is problematic because arrests don't perfectly correlate with actual criminal behavior, and false arrests disproportionately affect Black people, introducing racial bias.\n\n2. The training data collection process relies on subjective decisions about what characteristics to include and on self-reported information from defendants, both sources of potential bias.\n\n3. The interpretation of fairness used in COMPAS (equal predictive accuracy across groups) is just one of multiple valid interpretations, and choosing it over others (like equal false positive rates) is a subjective value judgment.\n\n4. The premise that objectivity requires freedom from human bias and subjective decision-making cannot be met by any recidivism prediction tool.\n\n## Critical Examination:\n\nThe essay's main argument is logically sound. The premise that objectivity requires freedom from bias and subjectivity is reasonable, and the evidence presented supports the claim that COMPAS fails to meet this standard. The argument moves methodically from establishing the criteria for objectivity to demonstrating how COMPAS fails to meet them.\n\nThe strongest parts of the argument are the detailed examinations of how bias enters the system through the definition of recidivism and the discussion of competing fairness metrics. These are well-supported and technically accurate.\n\nThe essay could have been strengthened by more explicitly connecting the examples to philosophical concepts of objectivity. While the operational definition of objectivity (freedom from bias and subjectivity) is clear, more discussion of what objectivity means in a deeper philosophical sense might have added depth.\n\n## Assessment of How Well the Essay Addresses the Question:\n\nThe essay directly addresses the question of whether data-driven tools for recidivism risk assessment are objective. It provides a clear answer (no), supported by detailed reasoning. The analysis focuses specifically on the claim of objectivity made by proponents, making the response highly relevant to the question.\n\nThe essay goes beyond merely asserting that the tools aren't objective; it systematically examines different aspects of objectivity and how the tools fail to meet them. The conclusion even suggests a policy implication (reconsidering the use of COMPAS), which is appropriate for a philosophy and public policy course.\n\nOverall, this is a strong essay that demonstrates critical thinking, understands the relevant literature, and directly answers the question with a well-structured argument."

         "Thesis: The essay presents a clearly stated thesis that decisively answers the question: \"The firm should define 'fair' based on the stage of the ATS pipeline.\" The thesis appears after establishing premises and directly addresses the question of how fairness should be implemented in ML/NLP resume screening. The thesis is further developed later in the essay when the student specifies which fairness definitions should be used at which stages: \"At earlier stages of the process, ensuring the algorithm does not favour one group over the other based on error rates alone is crucial (equalised odds)...\" and \"In later stages, predictive parity is the more suitable as a metric of fairness.\"",
         "Argument Validity: The essay presents four explicit premises that build toward a logical conclusion. The premises are clearly labeled:\n\nPremise 1: \"Methods of defining and achieving fairness are tools – they have strengths and weaknesses.\"\nPremise 2: \"Due to the Kleinberg–Chouldekova Impossibility Theorem, equalised odds and predictive parity are not compatible given differing base rates among groups.\"\nPremise 3: \"While causal matching presents an interesting mitigation... resumes alone often do not provide enough information...\"\nPremise 4: \"ATS uses a pipeline whose stages have different contextual requirements...\"\n\nThe conclusion follows logically from these premises. However, Premise 3 about causal matching lacks sufficient development—the concept is mentioned but not fully explained, and the essay doesn't thoroughly justify why resume data is insufficient for this approach.",

However, there appear to be some formatting issues with the mathematical expressions (e.g., \"y.\" appears several times), and some technical concepts could be explained more thoroughly for clarity.",

         "Let me thoroughly analyze this essay following the criteria:\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nLooking for the thesis statement in the essay:\n\n> \"Argument: The firm should define \"fair\" based on the stage of the ATS pipeline.\"\n\nThis appears to be the main thesis of the essay. The student is arguing that the definition of fairness in applicant tracking software should vary depending on which stage of the pipeline is being considered.\n\nThe thesis is stated explicitly, though it could be more developed in terms of explaining exactly what this means (i.e., which definitions should apply at which stages). Later in the essay, the student does elaborate that equalised odds should be used at earlier stages and predictive parity at later stages.\n\nBased on the rubric, this thesis seems to be between \"Excellent\" and \"Good\". It answers the question decisively but could be more explicitly developed.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nLet me identify the main premises and conclusion:\n\nPremise 1: \"Methods of defining and achieving fairness are tools – they have strengths and weaknesses. The two main methods (equalised odds, predictive parity) are considered \"fair\" in respect to the context in which they are applied.\"\n\nPremise 2: \"Due to the Kleinberg–Chouldekova Impossibility Theorem, equalised odds and predictive parity are not compatible given differing base rates among groups.\"\n\nPremise 3: \"While causal matching presents an interesting mitigation to the Kleinberg–Chouldekova Impossibility Theorem, resumes alone often do not provide enough information to identify structured and actionable causal variables.\"\n\nPremise 4: \"ATS uses a pipeline whose stages have different contextual requirements that affect which fairness definition is most appropriate.\"\n\nConclusion: \"The firm should define \"fair\" based on the stage of the ATS pipeline.\"\n\nThe premises are explicitly stated, and the student is building a logical argument. The conclusion does follow from the premises: if different fairness definitions have different strengths/weaknesses, cannot be used together, and the ATS pipeline has different requirements at different stages, then it makes sense to vary the definition of fairness by stage.\n\nThe argument has a valid form. However, there's a weakness in how thoroughly Premise 3 and Premise 4 are developed. The student mentions causal matching but doesn't fully explain what it is or why resumes don't provide enough information. Similarly, the student asserts that ATS stages have different requirements but could more thoroughly justify this claim.\n\nBased on the rubric, this criterion falls between \"Good\" and \"Excellent\". All premises are explicitly stated and the conclusion follows logically, but there are some gaps in fully developing all premises.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nExamining the student's understanding of the referenced texts:\n\nThe student references work by \"Kleinberg et al., Barocas et al., and Beigang\" and demonstrates understanding of key concepts like equalised odds, predictive parity, and the Kleinberg-Chouldekova Impossibility Theorem.\n\nKey quotes showing understanding:\n> \"For separation, we use \"equalised odds\" (EO) to create a situation where each group has the same error rates, such that both the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) are equal across groups.\"\n\n> \"For sufficiency, predictive parity (PP) is established by observing the positive predictive value (PPV) across groups.\"\n\nThe student demonstrates a good grasp of technical concepts and presents mathematical formulations, showing they understand the material. However, some of the mathematical expressions appear to have formatting issues (e.g., \"y.\" appears several times, which seems like a formatting error).\n\nThe student summarizes concepts mostly in their own words rather than relying on quotes, though there are some areas where further explanation would be beneficial.\n\nBased on the rubric, this criterion falls into the \"Good\" category. The student shows generally accurate summaries with some minor issues, mostly in their own words.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nStructure:\nThe essay follows a logical structure, starting with an introduction to the problem, presenting premises, stating the argument, and then developing the argument. The student breaks down the problem of fairness in ATS into suitable parts:\n1. Different methods of defining fairness\n2. The incompatibility of these methods\n3. Potential solutions and their limitations\n4. Application to different stages of the ATS pipeline\n\nKey quote on structure:\n> \"I choose to classify an ML/NLP employing stage based on who deserves fair treatment – either to the general population, or to the internal shortlist.\"\n\nAnalysis:\nThe student provides detailed analysis of the mathematical properties of different fairness definitions and their implications. However, the analysis could be more balanced - some parts receive more detailed treatment than others. For example, the mathematical presentation of the Impossibility Theorem is detailed, but the explanation of why different fairness definitions are appropriate at different stages could be more developed.\n\nClarity:\nThe essay generally uses clear language but includes some technical terminology without full explanation. There are also occasional awkward phrases or potential typos (like the \"y.\" that appears multiple times).\n\nBased on the rubric, this criterion falls into the \"Good\" category. The student provides a reasonable breakdown of the problem, though some parts are analyzed more thoroughly than others.\n\n## Main Argument and Supporting Points\n\nMain Argument: The firm should define fairness differently at different stages of the ATS pipeline, using equalised odds at earlier stages and predictive parity at later stages.\n\nSupporting Points:\n1. Different fairness definitions have different strengths and weaknesses that make them suitable for different contexts.\n2. Equalised odds and predictive parity cannot be simultaneously satisfied when base rates differ across groups (due to the Impossibility Theorem).\n3. At earlier stages of the ATS pipeline, equalised odds is more appropriate to avoid systematic discrimination against entire groups.\n4. At later stages of the pipeline, when the pool is smaller and more information is available, predictive parity becomes more appropriate.\n5. The structure of the firm and potential inconsistencies between stages need to be carefully managed to implement this approach successfully.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\nThe main argument is generally valid, but there are some areas that could be strengthened:\n\n1. The student asserts that equalised odds is better for early stages and predictive parity for later stages, but could provide more justification for this specific allocation.\n\n2. The student references causal matching but doesn't fully explain how it works or why it's not suitable in this context.\n\n3. The mathematical presentations sometimes lack clear explanation of their implications.\n\n4. The essay mentions \"happy\" and \"successful\" employees in the introduction but doesn't return to this specific goal later in the analysis.\n\n5. The conclusion about potential drawbacks of the approach is somewhat rushed and could be more thoroughly developed.\n\n## Assessment of Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear overall structure with an introduction, premises, argument, and development. However, some sections feel somewhat disjointed, particularly the mathematical sections.\n\nLanguage: The language is generally clear but sometimes overly technical without sufficient explanation. There appear to be some formatting or typing issues (the \"y.\" that appears several times).\n\nExamples: The essay is somewhat light on concrete examples. It discusses concepts abstractly but could benefit from more specific examples of how different fairness definitions would play out in real hiring scenarios.\n\nFocus: The essay stays focused on the question of fairness in ATS systems. It doesn't wander off-topic but could more clearly connect all points back to the central thesis.\n\n## How Well the Essay Addresses the Assigned Question\n\nThe essay addresses the assigned question of how a firm should use ML and NLP to screen resumes fairly. The student takes a clear position and develops an argument for using different fairness definitions at different stages of the process.\n\nHowever, the essay could more clearly connect back to the specific goal mentioned in the question - predicting which candidates will be \"happy\" and \"successful\" employees.

However, it could be strengthened with more concrete examples, clearer explanations of technical concepts, and a more thorough development of some premises."

         "Let me begin by breaking down this student essay according to the provided rubric criteria.\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nI need to identify whether the essay has a clear thesis that answers the question decisively. The question asks what definition of fairness a company should take when using ML for resume screening, and why.\n\nKey sentences related to thesis:\n- \"In this essay, I argue that counterfactual fairness should be the guiding principle in the design of machine learning based hiring systems.\"\n- \"A company should adopt a definition of fairness that is grounded in counterfactual fairness, which ensures applicants are carefully evaluated without the influence of systematic biases embedded in historical hiring practices.\"\n- \"As discussed in the lecture, counterfactual fairness ensures that individuals are treated the same regardless of socially sensitive attributes.\"\n\nAssessment: The essay has a clearly stated thesis that answers the question decisively. The student argues specifically for counterfactual fairness as the definition that companies should adopt for ML-based hiring systems. The thesis is presented early in the essay and the author returns to it throughout the paper.\n\nPreliminary rating: Excellent\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nI need to assess whether the premises are explicitly stated, whether the conclusion follows logically, and whether there are any fallacies.\n\nKey elements of the argument:\n- Premise: ML systems learn from flawed human decisions that reflect historical injustices and biases.\n- Premise: These biases can be perpetuated through \"proxy attributes\" that correlate with protected characteristics.\n- Premise: Counterfactual fairness ensures individuals are treated the same regardless of socially sensitive attributes.\n- Premise: True fairness requires not just \"removing race or gender\" but accounting for past discrimination.\n- Conclusion: Companies should adopt counterfactual fairness as their guiding principle.\n\nThe student references the \"New Jim Code\" from Benjamin (2019) and discusses the problem of \"garbage in, garbage out\" from Johnson (2020) to support these premises.\n\nAssessment: While the essay does present premises that support its conclusion, some connections between premises could be more explicit. The normative premise about why counterfactual fairness is the right approach (as opposed to other fairness definitions) could be developed more fully. The essay touches on historical biases, but could better articulate how counterfactual fairness specifically addresses these compared to alternative approaches. The basic logic flow is sound but some premises need stronger development.\n\nPreliminary rating: Good\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nI need to assess whether the referenced texts are accurately summarized in the student's own words without misinterpretations.\n\nKey references in the essay:\n- \"Johnson (2020) mentions the concept of how algorithmic biases have arisen from proxy attributes.\"\n- \"Benjamin (2019) addresses the extent to this critique, by introducing the concept of the New Jim Code.\"\n- \"A major concept that Johnson (2020) brings to light is the garbage in, garbage out issue; if an algorithm learns from biased hiring data, its predictions will perpetuate those biases.\"\n\nAssessment: The student references key concepts from the assigned readings (Benjamin's \"New Jim Code\" and Johnson's discussions of proxy attributes and \"garbage in, garbage out\"). These are generally accurately summarized in the student's own words. However, the essay does not develop these concepts in great depth or provide specific examples from the texts to illustrate them fully. The essay relies more on general references to the texts rather than specific, detailed analysis of their arguments.\n\nPreliminary rating: Good\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nI need to assess whether the problem is broken down into suitable parts, with appropriate level of detail and focused analysis.\n\nThe essay is structured into four main sections:\n1. Defining Fairness in Hiring Algorithms (Introduction)\n2. The Inescapable Reality of Bias in Algorithmic Hiring\n3. Implementing Fairness Beyond the Algorithm\n4. Confronting the Tradeoff Myth and Ethical Responsibilities\n5. The Call for Justice-Oriented Hiring (Conclusion)\n\nThis structure breaks down the problem into reasonable parts, moving from identifying the issue (bias in algorithmic hiring) to proposing a solution (counterfactual fairness) to addressing potential counterarguments (trade-off with accuracy) to concluding with broader implications.\n\nAssessment: The essay has a logical structure that breaks down the problem into suitable parts. However, the analysis within each section varies in depth. The explanation of counterfactual fairness itself could be more thorough, particularly in explaining precisely how it would be implemented in a hiring algorithm. Some parts of the analysis feel somewhat superficial or repetitive rather than developing the argument in depth.\n\nPreliminary rating: Good\n\n## Main Argument and Supporting Points\n\nMain argument: Companies should adopt counterfactual fairness as their definition of fairness for ML-based hiring systems because it ensures applicants are evaluated without the influence of systematic biases embedded in historical hiring practices.\n\nSupporting points:\n1. ML systems learn from historical data that reflects past discrimination and biases.\n2. These biases manifest through proxy attributes that correlate with protected characteristics.\n3. Counterfactual fairness requires that an individual's predicted outcome remains the same regardless of protected attributes.\n4. Implementing fairness requires going beyond algorithmic adjustments to include human oversight and structural changes.\n5. The supposed trade-off between fairness and accuracy is based on a limited definition of accuracy that ignores underlying biases.\n\n## Validity and Logical Consistency\n\nThe main argument is generally valid and logical, though there are some areas where the reasoning could be strengthened:\n\n1. The essay argues for counterfactual fairness but does not clearly explain how it would be implemented technically or compare it to other fairness definitions that might be considered.\n2. The essay mentions \"as discussed in the lecture, counterfactual fairness ensures...\" but doesn't fully explain the concept for readers who weren't in that lecture.\n3. The essay sometimes conflates different fairness definitions or approaches without distinguishing between them.\n4. There's a logical jump between identifying the problems with biased data and concluding that counterfactual fairness specifically is the solution.\n\n## Structure, Language, Use of Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear structure with defined sections that build upon each other logically.\n\nLanguage: The writing is generally clear but there are some awkward phrasings and grammatical errors (e.g., \"it p prioritizes\" instead of \"it prioritizes\"). Some sentences are overly complex or unclear.\n\nExamples: The essay provides some general examples (like how privileged access to top universities perpetuates advantage) but could benefit from more specific, concrete examples of how counterfactual fairness would work in practice.\n\nFocus: The essay stays focused on the question of fairness in ML-based hiring systems. However, it sometimes broadens too much into general discussions of bias and discrimination without tying these clearly back to the specific question of which fairness definition to adopt.\n\n## Addressing the Assigned Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the assigned question by arguing for counterfactual fairness as the definition a company should adopt. However, it could more explicitly compare this to alternative fairness definitions that might be considered (like demographic parity, equal opportunity, etc.) to strengthen the case for why counterfactual fairness specifically is the best choice.\n\nThe essay also emphasizes that technical fixes alone are insufficient, which is important but slightly shifts focus from the specific question of which fairness definition to adopt.\n\n## Additional Observations\n\n- The essay demonstrates personal engagement with the topic through statements like \"As a woman of color, I am deeply aware of how bias and racism manifest in algorithmic systems.\"\n- There's good recognition of the limitations of purely algorithmic approaches to fairness.\n- The essay relies more on general principles than specific technical details about how different fairness definitions work.\n- The essay tends to assert that counterfactual fairness is the solution without fully exploring potential drawbacks or limitations of this approach.\n\nOverall, this is a generally good essay that directly addresses the question and demonstrates understanding of relevant concepts. However, it could benefit from more technical precision in explaining counterfactual fairness, more explicit comparison with alternative fairness definitions, and more concrete examples of how the preferred approach would work in practice."

         "# Analysis of Student Essay\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nLet me first identify the thesis statement:\n\n> \"I argue that the company should adopt the equalized odds parity (separation criterion) as a definition for fairness when implementing a model for screening candidates.\"\n\nThe student clearly states their position in the introduction paragraph. The thesis directly answers the question of what definition of fairness the company should adopt. The student is taking a clear position by advocating for a specific fairness criterion (equalized odds parity/separation criterion) over other possible options.\n\nThe thesis is decisive and well-placed in the introduction, making it easy to identify the student's position from the start. The student also briefly notes their main reasons for this position: \"it balances fairness and merit-based hiring, while also ensuring fair distribution of errors.\"\n\nAssessment: Excellent - The thesis clearly answers the question decisively.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nThe main argument can be reconstructed as follows:\n\nPremise 1: A fair hiring system should reduce systematic discrimination.\nPremise 2: A fair hiring system should balance fairness with merit-based decisions.\nPremise 3: The separation criterion (equalized odds parity) ensures equal error rates across demographic groups.\nPremise 4: Equal error rates prevent qualified candidates from being disproportionately rejected based on their demographic group.\nPremise 5: Equal error rates allow qualified candidates to be selected based on merit rather than group membership.\nConclusion: Therefore, the separation criterion is the most suitable definition of fairness for the company's ML screening system.\n\nThe student explicitly states most of these premises throughout the essay. For example:\n\n> \"The Separation Criterion is the most suitable definition of fairness because it reduces systematic discrimination and balances fairness with merit-based hiring.\"\n\n> \"Equal distribution of errors prevents groups of qualified candidates from being disproportionately rejected from the hiring process.\"\n\n> \"Equalizing error rates instead of the independence criterion's approach of equalizing selection rates ensures that qualified candidates are selected fairly on account of merit rather than solely on group membership.\"\n\nThe student also addresses a potential counterargument:\n\n> \"Some may argue that the leeway separation criterion gives to merit-based hiring undermines fairness because conceptions of merit are not neutral.\"\n\nAnd provides a rebuttal:\n\n> \"The argument on merit is valid, but not incompatible with the separation criterion. Instead, it suggests that the screening model should not blindly accept conventional definitions of merit and deploy causal fairness approaches.\"\n\nThe premises are explicitly stated and the conclusion does follow logically from these premises. The student makes a clear normative argument about what counts as fair in this context and why the separation criterion meets these standards better than alternatives.\n\nAssessment: Good to Excellent - The premises are explicit, the conclusion follows logically, and key normative premises are present. The connections between premises and conclusion are clear. There are no obvious logical fallacies. However, some of the premises (particularly those about what constitutes fairness) could be developed with more philosophical depth.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nThe student demonstrates understanding of three definitions of fairness in machine learning:\n\n> \"Demographic Parity (independence criterion) asserts that a model is fair if group membership does not affect the classification outcomes. Essentially, this definition of fairness aims for equal acceptance rates across all groups.\"\n\n> \"Predictive Parity (sufficiency criterion) defines fairness as ensuring equal predictive value across groups.\"\n\n> \"The separation criterion identifies fairness as equal false positive and negative rates across groups.\"\n\nThe student correctly explains these technical concepts in their own words without misrepresentation. They refer to some external sources (e.g., \"Johnson, 2020\" and \"Beigang, 2023\"), though the citations are minimal and somewhat limited. The essay also references Judith Jarvis Thomson's trolley problem analogy:\n\n> \"I liken this equal chance to Judith Jarvis Thomson's perceived fairness of flipping a coin and assigning equal probability in the Trolley Bystander dilemma.\"\n\nThe student demonstrates a good understanding of the fairness criteria and applies them properly to the specific context of résumé screening. They accurately describe the potential issues with each approach.\n\nAssessment: Good - The student shows accurate understanding of the fairness criteria in their own words. There are no significant misunderstandings. The references to external sources are minimal but used appropriately. The essay could have benefited from more engagement with philosophical literature on fairness and justice.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nThe essay has a clear structure:\n- Introduction with thesis\n- Definitions of fairness criteria\n- Reasoning for choosing the separation criterion (with two main sections)\n- Evaluation and response to counterarguments\n- Conclusion\n\nThe student breaks down the problem effectively by first defining the three fairness criteria and then providing two main reasons for preferring the separation criterion:\n1. Reducing systematic discrimination\n2. Balancing fairness with merit\n\nThey then address counterarguments in the \"Evaluation\" section.\n\nThe analysis is focused and provides appropriate detail for each section. Examples are used effectively:\n\n> \"For instance, if 20% of qualified female candidates are rejected, while only 5% of qualified males are rejected, the model exhibits gender bias.\"\n\n> \"For instance, if the model favors ivy-league graduates when considering merit, it uses prestige of institutions as a proxy for race because historically, these universities have admitted fewer students of color.\"\n\nThe writing is generally clear, though there are a few minor grammatical errors and typos (e.g., \"arbrbitrary,\" \"fofor\"). The student maintains an appropriate academic tone throughout.\n\nThe essay addresses the question directly and stays focused on the topic of fairness in ML-based résumé screening. The level of detail is appropriate for the word limit, allowing the student to both explain the concepts and develop their argument.\n\nAssessment: Good to Excellent - The essay has a clear structure and focused analysis. The problem is broken down effectively, and the analysis is at an appropriate level of detail. The use of examples strengthens the arguments.\n\n## Main Argument and Supporting Points\n\nMain Argument: The separation criterion (equalized odds parity) is the most suitable definition of fairness for the company's ML résumé screening system because it both reduces systematic discrimination and balances fairness with merit-based hiring.\n\nSupporting Points:\n1. Equal error rates prevent qualified candidates from being disproportionately rejected based on demographic group membership.\n2. The separation criterion can help break cycles of historical bias by ensuring qualified candidates from all groups have equal probability of passing the screening.\n3. The separation criterion avoids the pitfalls of demographic parity (independence criterion) which can create artificial quotas and potentially lead to the \"Glass Cliff\" effect.\n4. While merit-based approaches can incorporate structural biases, the separation criterion can be implemented in ways that compare candidates with similar qualifications across demographic groups.\n5. The separation criterion focuses on procedural fairness rather than outcome justice, which is appropriate for the private sector context.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\nThe student's argument for the separation criterion is generally sound, though there are some areas that could be strengthened:\n\n1. The distinction between fairness and justice (attributed to Beigang, 2023) is an interesting philosophical point, but it could be developed further. The student uses this to justify focusing on procedural fairness over outcomes, but doesn't fully explore the normative implications.\n\n2. The analogy to Thomson's trolley problem seems somewhat forced and isn't fully developed. It's not entirely clear how the equal probability in the trolley problem relates to equal error rates in hiring.\n\n3. The student acknowledges that conventional definitions of merit can be biased but doesn't fully resolve this tension. Their solution of \"comparing candidates with similar qualifications across demographic groups\" seems to be a practical implementation detail rather than a philosophical resolution.\n\n4. The student could have more explicitly addressed the predictive parity (sufficiency criterion) option. While they explain why they prefer separation over independence, they don't provide as thorough an explanation for why separation is preferable to sufficiency.\n\n5. The argument about the private sector context and profit-driven goals is interesting but could be developed more thoroughly from a philosophical perspective. It raises questions about whether companies' obligations to fairness differ from those of public institutions.\n\nOverall, the student presents a valid argument with generally sound reasoning. The weaknesses are mostly in the depth of philosophical engagement rather than logical flaws.\n\n## Assessment of Question Response\n\nThe essay directly addresses the assigned question: \"What definition of fairness should the company take, and why?\" The student clearly states their position (separation criterion), defines the relevant concepts, provides reasons for their choice, and addresses potential counterarguments.\n\nThe essay stays focused on the specific context mentioned in the question (ML-based résumé screening for predicting successful and happy employees). The student considers the company's goals and the potential impacts on different demographic groups.\n\nThe response is appropriate for a philosophy and public policy course, as it engages with both technical definitions of algorithmic fairness and normative questions about what constitutes fairness in hiring practices.\n\nOverall, the essay effectively answers the question posed and demonstrates critical thinking about the philosophical dimensions of algorithmic fairness."

While these tools may seem objective due to their reliance on statistical models and grounding in quantitative data, I argue it is only such at face value.\"\n\nThe thesis is well-developed, identifying specific reasons why objectivity is compromised: \"the data itself is based in social biases, subjective assumptions, and measurement errors that serve to undermine any trace of objectivity.\" The essay consistently maintains this position throughout.",
         "**Argument Validity**\n\nThe essay constructs a generally valid argument that proceeds from clear premises to the conclusion. Key premises include:\n- Objectivity requires \"faithfulness to facts, value-freedom, and absence of personal bias\"\n- Operationalizations like \"new arrest within two years\" involve subjective choices\n- Arrest data reflects existing social biases, especially racial biases in policing\n- Therefore, recidivism risk assessment tools cannot be objective\n\nThe premises connect logically to the conclusion, and the normative premise about what constitutes objectivity is clearly presented.

That is to say data is created in and from the society that we have constructed.\"\n\nThe essay builds its argument through several premises:\n1. Objectivity requires faithfulness to facts, value-freedom, and absence of bias.\n2. Recidivism risk assessment tools use operationalizations (like \"new arrest within two years\") that involve subjective choices.\n3. These operationalizations have measurement errors and validity problems.\n4. The data used is socially constructed and reflects existing biases in policing and criminal justice.\n5. Therefore, these tools cannot be objective.\n\nThe premises are generally explicit, and the conclusion follows logically from these premises. The student connects the premises to the conclusion throughout the essay, showing how each premise undermines the claim of objectivity. The normative premise about what constitutes objectivity is clearly presented.\n\nAssessment: **Good** - Most premises are explicit, and the key normative premise about objectivity is present. The connection between premises and conclusion is clear, though there could be a more systematic presentation of the entire argument structure.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nKey sentences related to understanding:\n- \"Objectivity can be thought about in three different ways: (1) faithfulness to facts, (2) value-freedom, and (3) absence of personal bias, (from Objectivity Slides).\"\n- \"Jacobs and Wallach outline the importance of construct validity, assessing if a measurement accurately captures the intended construct or not.\"\n- \"As Hardt and Recht point out, the process of turning real-world phenomena into numerical data (quantization) involves choices that can introduce bias.\"\n\nThe essay demonstrates a strong understanding of key concepts related to objectivity, measurement, and construct validity. The student accurately references sources like Jacobs and Wallach, Hardt and Recht, and course materials on objectivity. The concepts are summarized in the student's own words rather than through extensive quotation. The explanation of different types of validity (construct, content, face, consequential) shows solid comprehension of the material.\n\nAssessment: **Excellent** - Referenced texts are accurately summarized in the student's own words with no apparent misinterpretations.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nKey sentences related to analysis, structure, and clarity:\n- \"In order to assess whether recidivism risk assessment tools are objective or not, we must first define what exactly objectivity means in the context of data science.\"\n- \"Having identified these limitations, we see how they undermine the content validity of the measurement since these variables do not fully capture the complexity of recidivism.\"\n- \"One might argue that recidivism risk assessment models are objective because they are based on mathematical and statistical models expected to be free from human bias. However, this argument overlooks the fact that the data used to train these models is itself biased.\"\n\nThe essay breaks down the problem of objectivity in recidivism risk assessment into logical parts:\n1. Defining objectivity\n2. Examining measurement and construct validity issues\n3. Analyzing the social construction of data\n4. Addressing counterarguments\n\nEach part receives appropriate attention, though the analysis of social construction could be more developed. The essay maintains focus on the central question throughout and provides examples to illustrate points (e.g., COMPAS risk assessment tool). The structure follows a logical progression, moving from definitions to specific problems to counterarguments.\n\nAssessment: **Good** - The problem is broken down in a reasonable way, though some parts (particularly the counterarguments section) could use more thorough analysis.\n\n## Main Argument\n\nThe main argument of the essay is that data-driven risk assessment tools for recidivism prediction are not objective because:\n1. The operationalization of recidivism as \"a new arrest within two years\" introduces biases\n2. The data used to train these models reflects social biases, especially racial biases in policing\n3. The measurement lacks construct validity as arrests are not reliable proxies for criminal behavior\n4. The tools perpetuate and potentially amplify existing inequalities in the criminal justice system\n\n## Supporting Points\n\n1. Measurement error: The essay argues that arrests are imperfect proxies for criminal behavior, as many crimes go unreported/unpunished, and arrests can result from racial profiling.\n\n2. Construct validity problems: The essay explains how the operationalization fails to capture the complexity of recidivism and introduces various validity issues (content, face, consequential).\n\n3. Social construction of data: The essay points out that the data used to train models is shaped by cultural, social, and institutional factors, particularly systemic racism in policing practices.\n\n4. Rejection of mathematical objectivity: The essay counters the argument that statistical models provide objectivity by showing that biased data inputs undermine any mathematical objectivity.\n\n5. Impact on fairness: The essay references how tools like COMPAS perpetuate racial disparities by disproportionately labeling Black defendants as \"high-risk.\"\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\nThe student's argument about objectivity is generally valid. The premises about how measurements and operationalizations introduce biases, and how data reflects social structures, logically lead to the conclusion that these tools lack objectivity. The student correctly identifies that mathematical models cannot overcome biased inputs.\n\nHowever, there are some weaknesses:\n- The essay could more explicitly address what would make a risk assessment tool objective, if that's even possible.\n- The discussion of the two-year threshold as \"arbitrary\" could be developed further with evidence or reasoning.\n- Some claims about racial bias in policing are presented as facts without specific citations or evidence.\n- The COMPAS example could benefit from more specific data points rather than general claims about bias.\n\nThe counterarguments section is somewhat brief and could address more sophisticated defenses of objectivity in these systems. The student primarily addresses mathematical objectivity and reproducibility but could explore other potential counterarguments.\n\n## Structure, Language, Examples, Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear, logical structure that proceeds from definitions to analysis to counterarguments to conclusion. Each section builds upon the previous one, though transitions between sections could be smoother.\n\nLanguage: The language is generally clear and accessible, avoiding unnecessarily complex jargon while still using appropriate technical terms related to validity and measurement.\n\nExamples: The essay uses COMPAS as a concrete example, which is helpful, but could benefit from more specific details or additional examples. The illustrations of bias in policing and arrests are somewhat general rather than specific.\n\nFocus: The essay maintains good focus on the central question of objectivity in recidivism prediction models throughout. It does not veer into tangential topics and stays targeted on the specific question asked.\n\n## Addressing the Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the assigned question: \"Data-driven tools for recidivism risk assessment operationalize recidivism as 'a new arrest within two years.' Proponents of such tools claim that such risk assessment tools are objective. Are they?\"\n\nThe student takes a clear position (that these tools are not objective) and provides multiple arguments to support this position. The essay engages with the specific operationalization mentioned in the prompt (\"a new arrest within two years\") and explains why this operationalization undermines objectivity claims.\n\nOverall, the essay successfully answers the question posed while demonstrating understanding of relevant concepts and presenting logical arguments.\n\n## Word Count Consideration\n\nThe essay appears to be within the 1500-word limit based on its length and level of detail. Given this constraint, the student made reasonable choices about which aspects to emphasize and which to address more briefly. The conceptual analysis receives appropriate emphasis, though some empirical examples could have been more detailed had space permitted.\n\n## AI Content Disclosure\n\nThe student disclosed using AI for an outline and for part of the conclusion section. This honesty is commendable, though it raises questions about how much of the thinking and argumentation is the student's own work. Without seeing the AI-generated content separately, it's difficult to assess how significantly it influenced the final essay."

The thesis is revisited in the conclusion with nuance: \"Based on the serious flaws seen in separation, it is easy to conclude that separation is not a viable option in practical applications where there is little data; however, I do not support blindly using sufficiency as the only alternative model for fairness.\"",
         "Argument Validity: The essay presents multiple premises that support its conclusion about the superiority of sufficiency over separation:\n1. \"Separation is data heavy and requires significantly more data than is required for sufficiency.\"\n2. \"Separation seeks to have better representation of groups that often have a lower percentage in total representation, but models based on separation can be heavily skewed if they are based on less data.\"\n3. \"In the event there is misclassification for the separation model, those who are misclassified either are significantly aided by falling into a group that has a higher rate of flagging...or they are significantly hindered.\"\n\nThe conclusion does follow from these premises, though some premises (particularly claims about data requirements) lack substantiation.

         "Let me analyze this essay according to the rubric criteria:\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nKey sentences related to the thesis:\n- \"I will argue about, and mention fairness in terms of sufficiency and separation, which are analogous to Beigang's paper on fairness and equalized odds and predictive parity respectively.\"\n- \"I will argue from the side of sufficiency by outlining the serious flaws that arise from relying on separation as fairness.\"\n- \"Based on the serious flaws seen in separation, it is easy to conclude that separation is not a viable option in practical applications where there is little data; however, I do not support blindly using sufficiency as the only alternative model for fairness.\"\n\nThe essay presents a thesis that argues for sufficiency over separation as a fairness criterion in machine learning for résumé screening. The thesis is present and takes a clear position, though it could be more explicitly stated early in the essay. The position seems to be that sufficiency is the better approach when faced with these two options, though with some caveats.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nKey sentences related to argument validity:\n- \"Out of all the issues with choosing separation, the concern about having enough data is the largest problem. Separation is data heavy and requires significantly more data than is required for sufficiency.\"\n- \"Separation seeks to reach fairness in the overall outcome, which is mentioned earlier. This is seen in recommending candidates that may not be seen as gaining the same total utility, again in this case success or happiness in a job, but the outcome of giving this higher opportunity to minorities within a specific category.\"\n- \"In the event there is misclassification for the separation model, those who are misclassified either are significantly aided by falling into a group that has a higher rate of flagging in this résumé example, or they are significantly hindered by being miscategorized as being in a group that has a lower rate of résumé flagging.\"\n\nThe essay provides premises to support its conclusion that sufficiency is preferable to separation. The main premises include:\n1. Separation requires more data than sufficiency\n2. Separation leads to different predictive rates between groups\n3. Separation creates problems with misclassification\n4. Sufficiency provides equal predictive power across groups\n\nThe conclusion that sufficiency is preferable does follow from these premises, though there are some leaps in logic or assumptions that aren't fully justified. The connection between premises and conclusion is reasonably clear, but some of the normative premises (why equal predictive power is better than equal representation) could be more explicitly defended.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nKey sentences related to understanding:\n- \"To begin with, sufficiency is a version of fairness that is based on having equal prediction power across different protected categories people fall into.\"\n- \"The separation definition of fairness is based more on having similar prevalence or representation in a nominal sense, but allowing for different rates of acceptance between these protected categories.\"\n- \"Sufficiency has great strengths because it avoids the major flaws inherent in separation, but the idea of separation conceptually is in the right place when it comes to seeking representation for minorities.\"\n\nThe student demonstrates understanding of the concepts of sufficiency and separation, which they relate to Beigang's paper (though they don't explain this connection in detail). The explanations are in the student's own words, though there could be more reference to specific literature or sources to strengthen the understanding section.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nKey sentences related to structure and clarity:\n- \"To begin with, sufficiency is a version of fairness that is based on having equal prediction power across different protected categories people fall into.\"\n- \"The separation definition of fairness is based more on having similar prevalence or representation in a nominal sense, but allowing for different rates of acceptance between these protected categories.\"\n- \"Why Separation Doesn't Work\"\n- \"Overall Assessment\"\n\nThe essay has a clear structure with defined sections: an introduction, definitions of key concepts, arguments against separation, and an overall assessment. The problem is broken down into suitable parts, with appropriate focus on the key differences between sufficiency and separation and the practical implications of each.\n\nThe analysis is focused and includes reasonable detail, though there could be more examples or case studies to illustrate the abstract points. Some parts (like the data requirements for separation) could use more explanation or evidence.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good\n\n## Main Argument\n\nThe main argument presented in the essay is that sufficiency is a better fairness criterion than separation for machine learning algorithms that screen résumés, primarily because separation has significant practical flaws related to data requirements, predictive power, and handling misclassification.\n\n## Supporting Points for the Main Argument\n\n1. Separation requires more data than sufficiency, making it less practical in real-world applications where data may be limited.\n2. Separation sacrifices unified prediction power across groups to achieve equal representation, potentially leading to different quality predictions for different groups.\n3. Separation creates significant problems with misclassification, where individuals incorrectly classified into certain groups may be unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged.\n4. Sufficiency provides equal predictive power across different groups, focusing on predicted success rather than representation.\n5. While both approaches have strengths and weaknesses, sufficiency is more practical in real-world applications with limited data.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\n1. Data Requirements Argument: The student claims separation requires more data than sufficiency but doesn't fully explain why or cite research supporting this claim. This is a key premise that could use more substantiation.\n\n2. Predictive Power Argument: The student argues that separation sacrifices unified prediction power across groups, which is a valid point, but doesn't fully explore why equal predictive power (sufficiency) is inherently better than equal representation (separation) from a normative perspective.\n\n3. Misclassification Argument: The student raises a good point about the problems of misclassification in separation, but doesn't compare this to potential misclassification issues in sufficiency approaches.\n\n4. The conclusion that sufficiency is better \"when forced between the two for practical applications\" follows from the premises, but the student acknowledges limitations in both approaches, showing nuanced thinking.\n\n## Essay Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear structure with an introduction, definitions, main arguments, and conclusion. The flow is logical and easy to follow.\n\nLanguage: The language is generally clear, though some sentences are complex and could be simplified for clarity.\n\nExamples: The essay lacks concrete examples or case studies to illustrate its points, which would strengthen the arguments.\n\nFocus: The essay maintains focus on comparing sufficiency and separation as fairness criteria for résumé screening algorithms, which directly addresses the assigned topic.\n\n## How Well the Essay Addresses the Assigned Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses fairness in machine learning for résumé screening, focusing specifically on comparing sufficiency and separation as fairness criteria. It takes a clear position favoring sufficiency while acknowledging its limitations. Without seeing the exact question prompt, it appears the essay is responsive to the assigned topic (Question 3).\n\nThe word count appears to be within the 1500-word limit, allowing sufficient depth of engagement given the constraints.\n\nOverall, the essay presents a reasonably well-structured and argued case for preferring sufficiency over separation as a fairness criterion in machine learning for résumé screening, though it could be strengthened with more concrete examples, more explicit reference to literature, and stronger justification for some of its key claims."

Thesis\n\nKey sentences related to thesis:\n1. \"The perceived objectivity of data science, combined with biased data, creates data science products with racist material anchors embedded in the design.\"\n2. \"There is a false assumption that data is objective, and when system designers do not actively evaluate their data systems, this biased data can perpetuate discriminatory practices and reinforce existing power structures.\"\n3. \"Next, I will argue that the illusion of neutrality in artificial intelligence and the outsourcing of accountability allow these material anchors to evolve into 'oppressive things' that perpetuate racism and uphold discriminatory power structures.\"\n\nThe essay has a clearly stated thesis that addresses how data science systems, due to their perceived objectivity combined with biased data, can create racist material anchors and perpetuate discrimination. The thesis is developed in the introduction, with the author explicitly stating their argument and outlining how they will approach it. The thesis directly takes a position on the topic.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent - The thesis is clearly stated, takes a decisive position, and outlines the argument that will follow.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nKey premises in the argument:\n1. Data science is perceived as objective but relies on data that is often biased or incomplete.\n2. Material anchors are physical manifestations of bias that both reflect and actively shape biases.\n3. Technology (like facial recognition, credit scores, risk assessment tools) produces material anchors based on biased data.\n4. The assumption that AI is neutral enables biased systems to become instruments of oppression.\n5. The outsourcing of accountability to machines insulates decision-makers from blame.\n6. Conclusion: Data science systems with biased data create racist material anchors that perpetuate discrimination.\n\nThe argument generally follows logically. The author defines key concepts (racism, material anchors, oppression) and connects them to show how biased data science systems can create material anchors that perpetuate racism. The connection between premises and conclusion is mostly clear, though some connections could be more explicitly developed.\n\nExamples used to support the argument include facial recognition systems having higher error rates for darker-skinned people, the COMPAS risk assessment tool producing biased results affecting Black defendants, and credit scoring algorithms penalizing individuals based on residential areas.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - Most premises are explicitly stated, and the conclusion follows logically, though some connections could be more fully developed.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nKey sentences demonstrating understanding:\n1. \"Material anchors, as defined by Liao and Huebner, are physical manifestations of bias. Material anchors 'are aspects of the physical world, which generate intrapersonal and interpersonal forms of stability in social spaces, by shaping patterns of association, behavior, and imagining,' (Liao and Huebner, 10-11).\"\n2. \"In Benjamin's article, he references Virginia Eubank's point that similar to humans, machines base their learning on existing data and cognition.\"\n3. \"These racist biases serve as anchors for social practices and, as Benjamin notes, make 'habituated biases seem natural,' (Benjamin, 3).\"\n\nThe essay accurately summarizes concepts from the referenced texts in the student's own words, particularly the concept of material anchors from Liao and Huebner and Benjamin's ideas about how technology can perpetuate biases. The student uses direct quotes appropriately to support their explanations rather than relying excessively on them. There are no apparent misinterpretations of the texts.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent - Referenced texts are accurately summarized in the student's own words with no apparent misinterpretations.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nStructure analysis:\n- Introduction: Introduces the problem, presents the thesis, outlines the paper's structure.\n- Discussion: \n  - Defines key concepts (racism, material anchors, oppression)\n  - Explains how technology can be biased based on data\n  - Discusses the assumption of AI neutrality\n  - Addresses the outsourcing of accountability\n  - Provides examples (facial recognition, COMPAS, credit scoring)\n  - Discusses how these systems create racist material anchors\n- Conclusion: Summarizes the argument and reiterates the main point about data science potentially being as biased as humans.\n\nThe essay has a clear structure with defined sections. The problem is broken down into suitable parts (perception of objectivity, biased data, material anchors, examples of systems). The analysis is focused, though some parts could be explored in more depth. The essay uses examples effectively to illustrate concepts and support arguments.\n\nThere are several typos and formatting issues throughout the essay (e.g., \"oftften\", \"fofor\", \"objbjectivity\"), which suggest potential technical issues during submission rather than writing errors.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - The essay has a reasonable breakdown of the problem, though some parts could be analyzed more thoroughly than others.\n\n## Main Argument and Supporting Points\n\nMain argument: The perceived objectivity of data science, combined with biased data, creates data science products with racist material anchors embedded in their design, which perpetuate discriminatory practices and reinforce existing power structures.\n\nSupporting points:\n1. Data science is wrongly perceived as objective, which creates a false sense of security.\n2. Material anchors in technology both reflect and actively shape biases.\n3. The assumption of AI neutrality allows biased systems to become oppressive.\n4. The outsourcing of accountability to machines insulates decision-makers from blame.\n5. Examples like facial recognition, COMPAS, and credit scoring demonstrate how biased data creates racist material anchors.\n\n## Critical Analysis\n\nThe argument is generally valid and logically consistent. The author makes a clear case for how the perception of objectivity combined with biased data leads to discriminatory outcomes. The connection between biased data and the creation of material anchors is well established.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas that could be strengthened:\n1. The essay could more explicitly connect how the material anchors \"evolve into oppressive things,\" as mentioned in the thesis. This transition is somewhat implied rather than directly explained.\n2. While the essay mentions the need for \"active intervention,\" it could provide more specific recommendations for addressing the problem.\n3. The concept of \"outsourcing accountability\" could be more fully developed to explain how exactly this contributes to perpetuating racism.\n\n## Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nLanguage: The essay uses appropriate terminology and explains concepts clearly. There are numerous typos and formatting issues (doubled letters, extra spaces), but these appear to be technical issues rather than writing errors.\n\nExamples: The essay uses relevant examples (facial recognition, COMPAS, credit scoring) to illustrate the concepts and support the argument. These examples effectively demonstrate how biased data creates material anchors that perpetuate discrimination.\n\nFocus: The essay stays focused on the main argument throughout. It doesn't drift into tangential topics and maintains a clear connection to the thesis.\n\n## Addressing the Assigned Topic\n\nWhile the specific question or topic assignment wasn't provided in the materials, the essay appears to effectively address issues of bias in data science, particularly relating to racism and discrimination. It draws on relevant literature (Benjamin, Liao and Huebner) to support its argument and directly engages with concepts of data objectivity, material anchors, and systemic discrimination.\n\nOverall, the essay demonstrates a solid understanding of the concepts and makes a coherent argument about how data science systems can perpetuate racism through material anchors. The structure is clear, the examples are relevant, and the language is appropriate for a philosophy and public policy course. The main weaknesses are some underdeveloped connections between concepts and the numerous typographical issues (which may be due to technical problems rather than the student's writing)."

         "You've written a thoughtful essay with a clear position and strong logical structure. Your explanation of why equalized odds is superior to predictive parity is compelling, especially your point that predictive parity tends to \"lock in\" historical biases while equalized odds helps mitigate them. Your example of the tech company with gender-biased hiring data was particularly effective at illustrating your argument.\n\nFor future essays, I'd recommend exploring potential counterarguments more thoroughly. While you acknowledge that equalized odds isn't perfect, you could strengthen your argument by directly addressing situations where critics might favor predictive parity or other metrics. Additionally, incorporating more diverse sources would enrich your analysis—while your engagement with Beigang is good, bringing in additional perspectives would help create a more comprehensive argument.\n\nOverall, this is solid work that demonstrates a good understanding of algorithmic fairness issues and makes a persuasive case for your position!",

         "I'll now conduct a thorough analysis of the student essay according to the provided rubric.\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nKey sentences related to the thesis:\n- \"In this essay, y, I argue that the company should adopt equalized odds as its fairness metric because it mitigates disparities in hiring without erasing historical nuance.\"\n- \"This paper breaks down what fairness actually means in hiring, why equalized odds is the better option, and how Beigang's (2023) critique of fairness metrics—especially around causal reasoning and decontextualization—can push companies to go beyond surface-level fixes.\"\n- \"Despite the limitations of statistical fairness, equalized odds is the best available approach for hiring algorithms because it actively prevents discrimination in selection while preserving some historical nuance.\"\n\nThe essay presents a clear thesis that takes a definitive position: that equalized odds is the best fairness metric for hiring algorithms. The thesis is explicitly stated in the introduction and reinforced throughout the essay. The author clearly explains why they believe equalized odds is superior to predictive parity and acknowledges the limitations of their chosen approach. The thesis directly answers what appears to be the implied question about which fairness metric a company should adopt.\n\nPreliminary Assessment: **Excellent** - The thesis is clearly stated and takes a decisive position on the question.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nThe main argument can be reconstructed as follows:\n\nPremise 1: A fair hiring algorithm should not perpetuate historical biases.\nPremise 2: Predictive parity assumes past hiring data is fair when it often isn't, thus perpetuating historical biases.\nPremise 3: Equalized odds ensures equal false positive and false negative rates across demographic groups, preventing disproportionate rejection.\nPremise 4: Equalized odds better aligns with legal and ethical hiring standards.\nConclusion: Therefore, equalized odds is the better fairness metric for hiring algorithms.\n\nKey sentences supporting this argument:\n- \"One of the biggest problems with predictive parity is that it assumes past hiring data is fair when it clearly isn't.\"\n- \"Equalized odds, on the other hand, ensures that women and men have similar false positive and false negative rates, forcing the system to stop filtering out women at a disproportionate rate.\"\n- \"Beyond theoretical advantages, equalized odds aligns more closely with anti-discrimination laws than predictive parity does.\"\n\nThe argument is mostly valid. The premises are explicitly stated throughout the essay, and they logically lead to the conclusion. The author clearly articulates why predictive parity is problematic (it perpetuates historical biases) and why equalized odds is preferable (it ensures equal error rates across groups and aligns with anti-discrimination laws).\n\nHowever, there is a slight weakness in that the essay doesn't fully explore potential counterarguments to equalized odds or situations where predictive parity might be more appropriate. The normative premise that a fair hiring algorithm should not perpetuate historical biases is present but could be more explicitly stated.\n\nPreliminary Assessment: **Good** - Most premises are explicit; premises are connected to the conclusion; but there could be more consideration of counterarguments.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nThe essay references Beigang (2023) multiple times:\n- \"But as Beigang (2023) argues, AI fairness often suffffers from gross decontextualization—meaning it's treated as an abstract math problem instead of something tied to real-world histories of discrimination.\"\n- \"Beigang critiques fairness metrics for their tendency to flatten historical context, arguing that fairness should not just be about balancing error rates but also about understanding the causal impact of sensitive attributes like race or gender.\"\n- \"Beigang warns that fairness metrics often overgenerate unfairness, meaning they sometimes flag disparities that aren't necessarily meaningful.\"\n\nThe essay demonstrates a good understanding of the concepts of equalized odds and predictive parity:\n- \"Equalized odds ensures that false positive and false negative rates are equal across demographic groups, preventing one group from being disproportionately rejected or falsely accepted.\"\n- \"Predictive parity ensures that once a candidate is selected, their probability of being 'successful' at the job is the same across groups.\"\n\nThe student summarizes Beigang's arguments in their own words and applies them to the specific context of hiring algorithms. There are no obvious misinterpretations of the source material. The essay effectively uses Beigang's critique to strengthen its argument for equalized odds.\n\nHowever, the essay could benefit from referencing more sources to provide a broader perspective on fairness in AI. There's also a lack of direct explanation of how Beigang specifically views equalized odds (as opposed to general fairness metrics).\n\nPreliminary Assessment: **Good** - Generally accurate summaries mostly in student's own words, but could include more diverse sources.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nThe essay breaks down the problem of fairness in hiring algorithms into several suitable parts:\n1. Definition of fairness in the context of hiring algorithms\n2. Comparison of equalized odds and predictive parity\n3. Arguments for why equalized odds is the better choice:\n   a. It reduces discriminatory hiring patterns\n   b. It preserves historical context\n   c. It aligns with legal and ethical standards\n4. Limitations of equalized odds and potential solutions\n5. Reframing the problem of what constitutes \"fair hiring\"\n\nThe structure is logical and flows well from defining the problem to proposing and defending a solution, then acknowledging limitations and reframing the broader issue. Each section builds upon the previous one to create a cohesive argument.\n\nThe essay includes a concrete example to illustrate its points:\n- \"Take a hiring model trained on historical data from a tech company where only 20% of past hires were women due to implicit bias. If the model is optimized for predictive parity, y, it will base its fairness calculations on past success rates, which are already skewed.\"\n\nThe clarity is generally good, though there are some typos and formatting issues (indicated by \"y,\" and \"difffferent\" with extra f's). There are also some redundancies in the introduction.\n\nThe analysis is focused and maintains appropriate depth for most parts of the essay. The student effectively contrasts equalized odds with predictive parity and explains why the former is preferable. However, the section on limitations of equalized odds could be more detailed and specific.\n\nPreliminary Assessment: **Good** - Reasonable breakdown of problem; the parts are analyzed with appropriate depth, though some sections could be more thorough.\n\n## Main Argument and Supporting Points\n\nThe main argument of the essay is that equalized odds is a better fairness metric for hiring algorithms than predictive parity because it mitigates disparities without erasing historical context.\n\nSupporting points:\n1. Predictive parity perpetuates historical biases by assuming past hiring data is fair.\n2. Equalized odds ensures equal false positive and false negative rates across demographic groups.\n3. Equalized odds better aligns with anti-discrimination laws and ethical hiring standards.\n4. While equalized odds isn't perfect, it preserves more historical nuance than predictive parity.\n5. Any fairness metric requires ongoing evaluation and involvement of diverse stakeholders.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\n1. The argument that predictive parity perpetuates historical biases is logical and well-supported with examples. The student correctly identifies that if past hiring data is biased, optimizing for predictive parity will maintain those biases.\n\n2. The explanation of how equalized odds works is accurate, but the essay could more explicitly address potential trade-offs between different fairness metrics. It's mathematically proven that different fairness metrics often can't be simultaneously satisfied, which isn't fully explored.\n\n3. The claim that equalized odds better aligns with legal standards is reasonable but lacks specific legal references or case studies to fully support it.\n\n4. The acknowledgment of equalized odds' limitations is a strength, but the proposed solutions are somewhat vague (\"test fairness metrics with real-world input\").\n\n5. The reframing section raises valid questions about what \"successful\" and \"happy\" employees mean, which effectively challenges the premise of what hiring algorithms should optimize for.\n\n## Essay Structure, Language, Use of Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. Each section logically follows from the previous one, creating a cohesive argument. The headings help organize the content effectively.\n\nLanguage: The language is generally clear and accessible, with technical terms explained appropriately. There are some typos and formatting issues that occasionally distract from the content.\n\nExamples: The essay uses a practical example about a tech company with gender-biased hiring to illustrate its point about predictive parity. However, more concrete examples would strengthen the argument, particularly in the sections about equalized odds' limitations and how to implement it effectively.\n\nFocus: The essay stays focused on comparing equalized odds and predictive parity as fairness metrics for hiring algorithms. It effectively connects these technical concepts to broader ethical considerations about fairness and discrimination.\n\n## Addressing the Assigned Question/Topic\n\nThe essay appears to be responding to a question about which fairness metric a company should adopt for its hiring algorithms. It directly addresses this question by arguing in favor of equalized odds over predictive parity, explaining the limitations of both, and suggesting implementation considerations.\n\nThe essay effectively connects the technical aspects of algorithmic fairness to broader ethical and societal concerns, showing an understanding that fairness is not just a statistical problem but also a social and ethical one.\n\nOverall, the essay provides a reasoned response to the apparent question, taking a clear position while acknowledging nuances and limitations.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe essay presents a clear thesis favoring equalized odds as a fairness metric for hiring algorithms. The arguments supporting this thesis are generally valid and logical, though some counterarguments could be more thoroughly addressed. The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the concepts and referenced literature, mostly summarized in the student's own words. The structure is logical and clear, breaking down the problem into suitable parts that are analyzed with appropriate depth. The essay effectively uses examples to illustrate its points, though more concrete examples would strengthen certain arguments. Overall, the essay directly addresses what appears to be the assigned question and makes a persuasive case for equalized odds while acknowledging its limitations."

         "Thesis\n\nThe essay presents a thesis that addresses the prompt, though it could be more explicitly articulated in a single decisive statement. The thesis is distributed across the introduction:\n\n\"Data science objects are proposed as a tool for objective unbiased decision making, but often just replicate past biases.\" \n\n\"Instead of helping us move forward into an unbiased society, they are taking us back to past biases, bounding us to the same rationales that dominated past thinking and shaped inequalities.\"\n\nThe essay takes a clear position that data science products do function as material anchors for racism, but this thesis could be more decisively stated.",
         "Argument Validity\n\nThe essay constructs a generally valid argument with the following key premises:\n1. Data science products use historical data for predictions and classifications\n2. This historical data contains biases reflecting past discrimination\n3. Algorithms trained on biased data reproduce those biases in their outputs\n4. These algorithms become integrated into institutional decision-making\n\nThese premises reasonably support the conclusion that data science products function as material anchors for racism. The essay employs examples to illustrate:\n\n\"For example, one product that affects everyday life is determining who gets a loan... The algorithm may not take race into consideration, but that zip code may be what is called a proxy variable...\"\n\nHowever, the normative premise (why perpetuating historical biases is wrong) remains somewhat implicit rather than fully articulated.

However, the essay does not cite or explicitly reference any course texts or scholarly literature on material anchors or algorithmic bias. This makes it difficult to assess whether the student is accurately summarizing course material or merely providing their own interpretation of these concepts.\n\nThe examples provided (NYC urban planning, loan algorithms, healthcare algorithms) are relevant but lack attribution to scholarly sources.",
         "Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nThe essay follows a logical structure with distinct sections: introduction, defining data science products, explaining material anchors, analyzing how data science products act as material anchors for racism, and a personal stance.

The discussion of how data science products act as material anchors could explore the mechanisms more thoroughly. The personal stance section includes repetition without adding substantial analytical content.\n\nThere are also occasional clarity issues, such as: \"These products of data science well understood and because of that the intent of their use is misaligned with the outcomes they are putting into society\" - this sentence is grammatically flawed and unclear.",

         "# Essay Analysis\n\nLet me carefully analyze this essay according to the provided rubric and guidelines.\n\n## 1. Thesis Analysis\n\nExamining the essay for a clear thesis statement:\n\nKey sentences related to the thesis:\n- \"Within this essay we will explore how data science products were once utilitarian models; they serve as material anchors in the postmodern landscape that perpetuate systems of oppression through the creation, maintenance, and augmentation of power.\"\n- \"Given that Postmodernism specifically looks at the ways that technological development disenfranchises minority groups on racial, ethnic, religious, cultural, and LGBTQ+ identities, pushing back on these power structures requires the dismantlement and understanding of the power structures that we live under.\"\n- \"While Data Science Products can be seen as material anchors that support racism and other systems of oppression that engage with socially embedded postmodern frameworks within our landscape, we must begin to push back on the majoritarian narratives that perpetuate systemic inequality within our country.\"\n\nThe essay does attempt to present a thesis that directly answers the question \"Can Data Science products be material anchors that support Racism?\" The student argues that yes, data science products serve as material anchors that perpetuate systems of oppression, including racism. The thesis is presented in the first paragraph and reinforced in the conclusion, though it could be more explicitly and concisely stated.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good** - The thesis is present but could be more explicitly stated.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity Analysis\n\nKey sentences related to argument structure:\n- \"As we set up our argument we need to understand a few things; what do I mean by material anchors, what is postmodernism within my analysis, and how can we understand not just racism but other systems of oppression.\"\n- \"To further apply these ideas we are going to look at two case studies.\"\n- \"Through the case studies we have clearly illustrated that AI models can perpetuate systemic harms against racial minorities and other marginalized peoples.\"\n\nThe main argument structure appears to be:\n1. Data science products can be understood as material anchors (devices that stabilize structures)\n2. Postmodernism provides a framework for understanding how power is maintained through technological innovation\n3. Case studies (St. George's Hospital and COMPAS) demonstrate how data science products perpetuate racism\n4. These inequities are difficult to address because they stem from decades of racially skewed data\n5. The powerful have vested interests in maintaining these inequitable systems\n6. Therefore, data science products function as material anchors that support racism\n\nMost premises are explicitly stated, though the connection between concepts of \"material anchors\" and \"postmodernism\" could be more clearly articulated. The student does attempt to define these terms but the definitions themselves are somewhat vague. The conclusion does logically follow from the premises presented, especially the case studies which provide empirical support.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good** - Most premises are explicit; the connection between premises and conclusion is mostly clear, though some premises could be more thoroughly developed.\n\n## 3. Understanding Analysis\n\nKey sentences demonstrating understanding:\n- \"Postmodernism is known for its critique of universal truths, and explanation of how power is maintained, and augmented through innovation and development.\"\n- \"Jean-Francios Lyotard, who is regarded as the first philosopher to use the term 'Postmodernism' said in his book The Postmodern Condition 'In the discourse of today's financial backers of research, the only credible goal is power. Scientists, technicians, and instruments are purchased not to find truth, but to augment power.'\"\n- \"The Social Strain Theory looks at the relationship between crime and a lack of economic opportunity in someone's life...\"\n- \"The Control/Restraint Theory looks at how Internal controls such as values and beliefs systems, external control such as interpersonal bonds (family, friends, social networks), and psychological control contribute to higher rates of crime.\"\n\nThe essay demonstrates some understanding of the relevant concepts, including postmodernism and the theoretical backgrounds of the COMPAS algorithm. There are some quotes from Lyotard, though otherwise the student generally summarizes ideas in their own words. The description of postmodernism is somewhat simplified, and the connection between postmodernism and the concept of \"material anchors\" could be better developed.\n\nThe student discusses the bias in AI systems with reasonable accuracy, though some details about how the algorithms actually work could be more precisely explained. The definition of \"material anchors\" appears to be the student's own, rather than a standard academic definition, which suggests some potential misunderstanding or oversimplification.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good to Needs Improvement** - The summaries are generally accurate but with some oversimplifications and potential misunderstandings. The connection between postmodernist theory and the empirical cases could be more clearly articulated.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nKey sentences demonstrating analysis and structure:\n- \"As we set up our argument we need to understand a few things; what do I mean by material anchors, what is postmodernism within my analysis, and how can we understand not just racism but other systems of oppression.\"\n- \"To further apply these ideas we are going to look at two case studies.\"\n- \"Through the case studies we have clearly illustrated that AI models can perpetuate systemic harms against racial minorities and other marginalized peoples. However addressing these inequities becomes harder than simply reformulating a model.\"\n\nThe essay has a clear structure with an introduction, definition of key terms, case studies, analysis of deeper issues, and a conclusion. The problem is broken down into suitable parts, moving from theoretical framework to empirical cases to broader societal implications.\n\nThe essay does focus on a few key points (material anchors, postmodernism, case studies of biased algorithms) and attempts to develop them. The analysis of the COMPAS algorithm is particularly detailed, examining the theoretical assumptions behind it and how these can lead to racial bias.\n\nHowever, the analysis is somewhat imbalanced. The discussion of postmodernism and material anchors is relatively brief compared to the case studies. The essay would benefit from a more thorough analysis of how data science products specifically function as \"material anchors\" beyond just perpetuating bias.\n\nAdditionally, there are some clarity issues with repetitive phrasing (e.g., multiple \"Within this essay\" statements) and some typographical inconsistencies (e.g., \"WiWithin\", \"LyLyotard\", \"difffferent\").\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good** - Reasonable breakdown of the problem with some parts analyzed more thoroughly than others. The structure is clear, though some aspects could be better developed.\n\n## Main Argument and Supporting Points\n\nMain Argument: Data science products function as material anchors in a postmodern landscape, perpetuating systems of oppression including racism through the creation, maintenance, and augmentation of power.\n\nSupporting Points:\n1. Historical data used in algorithms often contains racial biases from past discriminatory practices\n2. The St. George's Hospital case study shows how AI screening can perpetuate discrimination\n3. The COMPAS algorithm disproportionately classifies Black defendants as high risk due to its reliance on factors correlated with race and socioeconomic status\n4. The powerful have vested interests in maintaining these inequitable systems\n5. The postmodern framework helps explain how technological developments serve to maintain existing power structures\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\nThe student's argument about the St. George's Hospital case shows how algorithms can perpetuate historical biases, which supports the main thesis. However, the student could have more clearly explained how this specifically functions as a \"material anchor\" rather than just an example of algorithmic bias.\n\nThe analysis of the COMPAS algorithm is detailed and effective, showing how seemingly neutral factors like education, family structure, and neurological conditions can have racially disparate impacts. This provides strong support for the claim that data science products can support racism.\n\nThe appeal to postmodernism and power structures adds theoretical depth, but the connection between postmodernism and the concept of \"material anchors\" is not fully developed. The student introduces both concepts but doesn't clearly articulate how they work together in their theoretical framework.\n\nThe argument that powerful groups will resist giving up power is presented without much evidence or analysis, and seems somewhat disconnected from the earlier, more empirical arguments about algorithmic bias.\n\n## Assessment of Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear structure with an introduction, definition of key terms, case studies, analysis, and conclusion. The student signals transitions between sections, which aids clarity.\n\nLanguage: The language is generally clear but there are numerous typographical inconsistencies and some repetitive phrasing. Some sentences are overly complex, which impacts clarity.\n\nExamples: The essay uses two strong examples (St. George's Hospital and COMPAS) that effectively illustrate how data science products can perpetuate racial bias. These examples are discussed in appropriate detail.\n\nFocus: The essay stays focused on the question of whether data science products can be material anchors that support racism. The inclusion of postmodernism and power structures is relevant to this focus, though could be better integrated.\n\n## How Well the Essay Addresses the Assigned Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the assigned question \"Can Data Science products be material anchors that support Racism?\" The student argues that yes, they can and do support racism, and provides evidence through case studies.\n\nHowever, the concept of \"material anchors\" is not fully developed. The student defines them as \"devices used to stabilize or uphold systems of oppression\" but doesn't clearly explain how data science products specifically function as stabilizing devices beyond just perpetuating bias. This represents a missed opportunity to more directly address the \"material anchor\" aspect of the question.\n\nOverall, the essay does address the question but could have more thoroughly explored the \"material anchor\" concept that was central to the question.\n\n## Word Count Consideration\n\nThe essay appears to be close to the 1500-word limit, which may explain why some concepts are not fully developed. Given this constraint, the student has made reasonable choices about which aspects to emphasize, though the balance could be improved with less repetition and more focused analysis of key concepts."

         "Let me begin by carefully reading the essay to understand its thesis, arguments, structure, and how it addresses the question. The prompt asks whether data-driven tools for recidivism risk assessment that operationalize recidivism as \"a new arrest within two years\" are objective, as proponents claim.\n\n## 1. Thesis\nLet me identify the thesis statement in this essay:\n\nFrom paragraph 2:\n\"I argue that while advocates for recidivism risk assessment tools claim them to be objective and neutral predictors, in reality, these tools often encode human bias and perpetuate or even amplify inequalities; these models do not reflect objective reality, but instead reflect historic inequities and flawed data.\"\n\nThis is a clear thesis statement that directly answers the question. The student takes a decisive position that these tools are not objective, despite claims that they are. They specifically argue that the tools encode bias, perpetuate inequalities, and reflect historic inequities and flawed data.\n\nAssessment for Thesis: Excellent. The thesis is clearly stated and answers the question decisively.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\nLet me examine the key premises and whether they lead logically to the conclusion:\n\nPremise 1: Machine learning algorithms are being integrated into the criminal justice system to predict recidivism.\nPremise 2: Data used to train these algorithms is flawed or incomplete.\nPremise 3: These algorithms capture and encode historical biases present in law enforcement and the criminal justice system.\nPremise 4: The LSI-R (a common recidivism risk assessment tool) asks questions that disproportionately disadvantage those from lower socio-economic backgrounds and minorities.\nPremise 5: Statistical models learn biases through interaction with biased data and human judgments.\nConclusion: Recidivism risk assessment tools are not objective; they perpetuate and amplify inequalities rather than reflecting objective reality.\n\nThe student provides several examples and references to support these premises:\n- They cite Ludwig and Mullainathan's article \"Fragile Algorithms and Fallible DecisionMakers\" to support the claim that algorithms fail to achieve desired accuracy rates.\n- They reference Cathy O'Neil's \"Weapons of Math Destruction\" to explain how algorithms cater to privileged individuals while exacerbating discrimination.\n- They provide examples of how the LSI-R questionnaire includes proxy information for race and class, though not explicitly asking about race.\n\nThe premises are connected logically to the conclusion. The student argues that since the data used to train these algorithms is biased and incomplete, and since the algorithms pick up on historical patterns of discrimination, they cannot be considered objective.\n\nAssessment for Argument Validity: Good to Excellent. Most premises are explicitly stated, and the conclusion follows logically from them. The student effectively connects the premises to the conclusion. There could be a bit more explicit discussion of what objectivity means in this context.\n\n## 3. Understanding\nThe student references and summarizes two key texts:\n1. Ludwig and Mullainathan's \"Fragile Algorithms and Fallible DecisionMakers\"\n2. Cathy O'Neil's \"Weapons of Math Destruction\"\n\nFrom the essay:\n\"Ludwig and Mullainathan, in their article Fragile Algorithms and Fallible DecisionMakers, show that these algorithms, while achieving their goal of consistency, did not achieve the desired accuracy rates. Some algorithms made errors at a similar rate as judges, and others actively perpetuated discrimination.\"\n\nAnd:\n\"Cathy O'Neil details the ways in which algorithms tend to positively cater to already-privileged individuals while exacerbating discrimination and prejudice among minorities and disadvantaged groups in her text, Weapons of Math Destruction.\"\n\nThe student demonstrates a good understanding of these texts and accurately summarizes their key points in their own words. They use the texts to support their arguments about how recidivism risk assessment tools can perpetuate bias.\n\nAssessment for Understanding: Good to Excellent. The student accurately summarizes referenced texts in their own words with no apparent misinterpretations. They could have referenced more literature on the topic of algorithmic fairness or recidivism prediction specifically.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\nThe student breaks down the problem of algorithmic objectivity in recidivism prediction into several components:\n1. The appeal of using algorithms in criminal justice\n2. The challenges in developing accurate models\n3. How bias enters algorithms through data\n4. How specific tools like LSI-R encode bias\n5. The potential for improvement and ethical considerations\n\nThe essay has a clear structure with an introduction, themed sections, and a conclusion. The student focuses primarily on how bias enters algorithms and provides specific examples, particularly regarding the LSI-R assessment tool.\n\nFrom the essay:\n\"Though LSI-R does not explicitly ask illegal questions regarding race, the data collected from the survey includes enough proxy information that race is essentially included despite not being explicitly stated.\"\n\nThe student balances acknowledging potential benefits of algorithms with critiquing their current implementation:\n\"It is clear that data science has the potential to be a positive tool in the criminal justice system, if used correctly. However, this often is not the case, and current recidivism risk assessment tools as whole are not objective.\"\n\nHowever, the analysis could go deeper into specific questions on the LSI-R and how they create bias. The essay also doesn't fully explore what objectivity means in this context - is it about accuracy, fairness, or both?\n\nAssessment for Analysis, Structure, and Clarity: Good. The essay has a clear structure and breaks the problem down appropriately. The analysis is focused but could go deeper in some areas.\n\n## Main Argument\nThe main argument of the essay is that recidivism risk assessment tools are not objective because they encode human biases present in historical data and perpetuate or amplify existing inequalities in the criminal justice system.\n\n## Supporting Points\n1. The data used to train these algorithms is flawed and incomplete, reflecting historical patterns of discrimination in policing and criminal justice.\n2. Specific tools like LSI-R include questions that serve as proxies for race and socioeconomic status, disadvantaging already marginalized populations.\n3. Even well-designed algorithms learn biases from the data they're trained on, creating a feedback loop that reinforces existing inequalities.\n4. The technical disconnection between data scientists and social realities leads to systems that fail to account for real-world complexities and biases.\n5. The consequences of these biased predictions are significant, potentially altering individuals' lives through longer sentences and increased likelihood of future incarceration.\n\n## Critical Examination\nThe student's argument is generally valid and well-supported. The connection between biased data, algorithmic learning, and perpetuation of inequality is logically sound. The essay effectively demonstrates how recidivism risk assessment tools can encode and perpetuate bias.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the argument could be strengthened:\n1. The essay doesn't deeply engage with potential counterarguments, such as claims that these tools could be improved or that they're still more objective than human judges despite their flaws.\n2. The student could more explicitly define what \"objectivity\" means in this context.\n3. While the student mentions \"inaccurate algorithms,\" they don't fully explore the relationship between accuracy and bias/objectivity.\n4. The essay could benefit from more specific examples of how bias has been demonstrated in real-world deployments of these tools.\n\n## Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\nStructure: The essay has a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs organized by theme, and a conclusion. The section headers help organize the content.\n\nLanguage: The language is generally clear, though there are numerous formatting errors with doubled letters and spaces that make some sentences harder to read.\n\nExamples: The student effectively uses the example of LSI-R and its questionnaire to illustrate how bias enters recidivism prediction tools. They also cite statistics about stop-and-frisk in New York City to support claims about biased policing.\n\nFocus: The essay maintains focus on the question of objectivity in recidivism risk assessment tools. It doesn't stray into unrelated topics.\n\n## Addressing the Assigned Question\nThe essay directly addresses the assigned question: \"Data-driven tools for recidivism risk assessment operationalize recidivism as 'a new arrest within two years.' Proponents of such tools claim that such risk assessment tools are objective. Are they?\"\n\nThe student clearly argues that these tools are not objective, providing reasons and evidence to support this position. They acknowledge the claims of proponents but challenge the notion that these tools are objective by highlighting how they encode and perpetuate bias.\n\nOne limitation is that the essay doesn't fully explore what \"objectivity\" means in this context. Is objectivity about accuracy in prediction? About fairness across different demographic groups? About independence from human biases? The essay implies various answers but doesn't explicitly define objectivity.\n\n## Word Count Consideration\nThe essay appears to be within the 1500-word limit based on its length. The student has adequately developed their argument within this constraint, though some areas (such as defining objectivity and exploring counterarguments) could have been expanded with additional space.\n\n## Summary Assessment\nThe essay presents a clear thesis that directly answers the question, arguing that recidivism risk assessment tools are not objective. The argument is generally valid, with premises that logically support the conclusion. The student demonstrates good understanding of the referenced texts and uses them effectively to support their argument. The essay is well-structured and focused on the assigned question.\n\nAreas for improvement include more explicit definition of objectivity, deeper engagement with counterarguments, more specific examples of bias in real-world deployments, and cleaner formatting. However, overall, this is a strong essay that effectively addresses the assigned question."

         "# Thesis Analysis\n\nLet me identify the thesis statement of this essay:\n\n> \"This final recommendation will be to apply the definition of separation, which requires equal false and true positive rates across groups. This definition allows for a balance to be attained where a company can focus on diverse hiring practices, while still ensuring that each new employee hired will have the optimal probability to continue on successfully in the company.\"\n\nThis appears at the end of the introduction paragraph. The student clearly states that they will recommend the \"separation\" definition of fairness and provides a brief justification. The thesis directly answers the question asked about what definition of fairness the company should adopt.\n\nAdditional relevant quote:\n> \"As a result, I recommended that the separation definition be used when creating this machine learning system. This definition allowed for a balance between diverse hiring practices, and recruiting the most effffective, successful team possible.\"\n\nAssessment: The thesis is clearly stated and answers the question decisively. The student takes a clear position by recommending separation as the fairness definition the company should adopt. This meets the criteria for \"Excellent\" in the Thesis category.\n\n# Argument Validity Analysis\n\nThe essay's main argument structure is:\n1. Three definitions of fairness are considered: independence, sufficiency, and separation\n2. Independence is rejected because it may lead to \"overcorrection\" and doesn't prioritize employee success\n3. Sufficiency is rejected because it doesn't address historical bias and might limit diversity\n4. Separation is recommended because it balances diverse hiring practices with effectiveness\n\nLet me analyze the premises and conclusions:\n\nFor the rejection of independence:\n> \"This leads to a central flaw of the independence definition of fairness, which is that it requires equal base rates across groups in order to be successful in achieving demographic parity without inevitably making poor predictions which leads to the overrepresentation of a group that may not be properly qualified.\"\n\nFor the rejection of sufficiency:\n> \"A disadvantage of the use of this definition is that it takes no effffort to combat the difffferential base rates of success for protected groups, which is caused by historical bias and discrimination still present in our society today.\"\n\nFor the recommendation of separation:\n> \"Pros for using this definition include that it has the benefit of balancing hiring opportunity with risk, not overcompensating to ensure diversity as independence could lead one to do, and that it is able to deal with historical bias by focusing on the outcomes of this hiring system.\"\n\nThe connection between premises and conclusion is generally clear. The student identifies specific flaws in the independence and sufficiency definitions that make them less suitable, and then highlights the advantages of separation that address the identified problems.\n\nHowever, I notice that some premises aren't fully developed. For example, the student claims that separation \"combats historical bias\" but doesn't fully explain the mechanism by which equalizing error rates addresses historical bias. There also appears to be a missing premise connecting equality of false positive/negative rates to actual fairness in hiring outcomes.\n\nAssessment: Most premises are explicit; there are some minor premises missing (especially around how separation addresses historical bias); the key normative premise that fairness should balance diversity with effectiveness is present; premises are generally connected to the conclusion. This falls into the \"Good\" category for Argument Validity.\n\n# Understanding Analysis\n\nThe essay references Barocas' \"Fairness and Machine Learning\" and correctly identifies three definitions of fairness: independence, separation, and sufficiency. These are described in the student's own words:\n\nIndependence:\n> \"This definition of fairness is given as ensuring equal hiring rates across difffferent protected groups, done by making the protected characteristic 'independent' of the data used by the machine to generate a prediction.\"\n\nSeparation:\n> \"In action, this definition seeks to ensure that there will be equal rates between the false positive rate (FPR) and the false negative rate (FNR).\"\n\nSufficiency:\n> \"This definition of fairness has to do with equalized risk rates, seeking to create a machine-learning system that gives each potential employee a score. The key with this scoring is that for difffferent groups, a specific score denotes the same possibility of success or failure for an individual, regardless of the protected group they are associated with or the group's base rate for success.\"\n\nThese explanations are generally accurate, although there are some minor imprecisions. For instance, the student's explanation of separation focuses on equality between FPR and FNR, whereas separation actually refers to equality of these rates across different protected groups (which the student does correctly mention later). The student also correctly mentions concepts like \"redundant encodings\" and applies them to the context.\n\nThere are no obvious misinterpretations of the referenced texts, and the student uses their own words throughout.\n\nAssessment: Referenced texts are accurately summarized in the student's own words with only minor imprecisions. This meets the criteria for \"Good\" in the Understanding category.\n\n# Analysis, Structure, and Clarity Analysis\n\nThe essay has a clear structure:\n1. Introduction with thesis statement\n2. Analysis of independence definition\n3. Analysis of sufficiency definition\n4. Analysis of separation definition\n5. Conclusion reiterating the recommendation\n\nThe problem is appropriately broken down into parts, examining each definition of fairness in turn and analyzing their strengths and weaknesses in the context of résumé screening. The student focuses on key points for each definition:\n\nFor independence:\n> \"However, despite one's best efffforts to remove sensitive characteristics, they have a way of continuously popping back up through what data scientists call 'redundant encodings'.\"\n\nFor sufficiency:\n> \"While we know that our system would be 'fair' in that each individual is given a score which holds the same likelihood of success, there could be disparity in the average scores given to members of difffferent groups.\"\n\nFor separation:\n> \"This is a strong advantage for this definition - it is able to combat historical bias through the equalization of these two error rates across groups. Where independence can have too strong of a hand in undoing historical bias, and sufffficiency has the legitimate possibility of perpetuating it, this definition strikes a perfect balance.\"\n\nThe level of detail is generally appropriate, although the explanation of how separation actually works to combat historical bias could be more detailed. The student also acknowledges a disadvantage of separation:\n\n> \"This isn't to say that this is perfect for building a machine learning system - this definition is rather data-intensive, as one must keep careful track of the various rates, monitoring individuals for their success, in order to create a continuously successful system.\"\n\nThe essay maintains focus throughout, keeping the analysis relevant to the question of which fairness definition a company should adopt for résumé screening.\n\nThere are some clarity issues, including repeated characters (e.g., \"difffferent\", \"sufffficiency\") and occasional unclear pronoun references (e.g., \"y,\" which appears multiple times), which may be formatting or transcription errors.\n\nAssessment: The problem is broken down into suitable parts with appropriate level of detail and focused analysis, despite some minor clarity issues and areas where more detail would be beneficial. This meets the criteria for \"Good\" to \"Excellent\" in the Analysis, Structure, and Clarity category.\n\n# Main Argument and Supporting Points\n\nMain Argument: The company should adopt the separation definition of fairness for its ML résumé screening system because it provides the best balance between ensuring diverse hiring practices and hiring successful employees.\n\nSupporting Points:\n1. Independence is flawed because it may lead to \"overcorrection\" of historical bias at the expense of hiring qualified candidates.\n2. Sufficiency fails to address historical biases and may perpetuate existing disparities in representation.\n3. Separation combats historical bias by equalizing error rates across groups without sacrificing quality of hires.\n4. Separation focuses on outcomes, providing a framework for building an efficient team while preventing discrimination.\n5. While data-intensive, separation's benefits in balancing fairness and effectiveness outweigh this drawback.\n\n# Critical Examination of Arguments\n\nThe student's argument against independence is reasonably strong. They correctly identify that forcing equal hiring rates across groups could lead to poor predictions if base rates are actually different, which could result in hiring less qualified individuals.\n\nThe argument against sufficiency is also plausible - if a definition of fairness doesn't address historical bias, it may perpetuate existing disparities. However, the student could have strengthened this by explaining more clearly why this matters to the company (beyond vague references to \"perspectives\").\n\nThe argument for separation has some weaknesses. The student asserts that equalizing false positive and negative rates across groups will combat historical bias, but doesn't fully explain the mechanism. There's also an unaddressed tension: if base rates of qualification differ across groups (as acknowledged in the independence section), how does equalizing error rates actually achieve fairness while maintaining quality? The student claims separation strikes a \"perfect balance\" but this claim isn't fully justified.\n\nAdditionally, the student mentions that separation is data-intensive but dismisses this concern quickly without thoroughly weighing this practical limitation against the others.\n\n# Assessment of Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear and logical structure, examining each definition in turn before reaching a conclusion. The introduction previews the argument, and the conclusion summarizes it effectively.\n\nLanguage: The language is generally clear and appropriate for an academic essay, though there are some typographical issues (repeated letters, unclear uses of \"y,\" etc.) that impact readability.\n\nExamples: The essay lacks concrete examples of how each definition would work in practice. For instance, the student could have provided a hypothetical scenario showing how separation would lead to different hiring decisions than the other definitions.\n\nFocus: The essay maintains good focus throughout, staying relevant to the question of which fairness definition the company should adopt. Each paragraph contributes to the overall argument.\n\n# Addressing the Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the question posed: \"What definition of fairness should the company take, and why?\" The student clearly recommends separation as the definition the company should adopt and provides reasoning for this choice.\n\nThe essay considers the specific context of the question (résumé screening for predicting successful and happy employees) and evaluates the fairness definitions in light of this context. The student considers the company's interests (hiring successful employees) while also addressing broader societal concerns (avoiding discrimination, addressing historical bias).\n\nOverall, the essay addresses the assigned question thoroughly and directly."

Thesis\n\nHere are key sentences related to the thesis:\n\n\"For this essay, overall use of motion sensors and cameras and how the limited \"thinking\" they are allowed, while making some people uncomfortable, is a constraint of technology and projection of larger issues rather than an act of mechanized racism.\"\n\n\"These limited thought, 'dumb' data science products often fall under misuse or insufficient data but to say these material anchors support racism is far from fact.\"\n\nThe student's thesis appears to be that basic data science products (like motion sensors and cameras) are not themselves racist or supporting racist norms. Rather, they argue that perceived racism in these technologies is due to technological limitations and projection of human issues onto the technology.\n\nThis thesis does answer the question posed in the title: \"Can data science products be 'material anchors' that support racism?\" The student's answer is essentially \"no\" - at least for basic \"dumb\" data science products. They specifically distinguish these from generative AI systems.\n\nAssessment: The thesis is present but could be more explicitly stated. The student's position is somewhat clear but there's room for a more decisive statement. The thesis statement is embedded in the introduction rather than standing out clearly.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good**\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nKey sentences related to argument validity:\n\n\"They are not making racist decisions on the spot each time they are operated in a new scenario simply because they lack the ability to do so.\"\n\n\"If for any reason the sensor cannot reflect, then it cannot function. This can be due to one not positioning themselves correctly to cause the reflection (operator error) or because the sensor itself is not strong enough to be reflected and instead becomes absorbed by what is presented in front of it (in this case, the hand of a darker skinned black man).\"\n\n\"Cameras are smart enough to auto focus, adjust for any reason, and even recommend certain features to the user. But these are all based on limited data that correspond to certain preprogrammed checklists or scenarios...\"\n\nThe main argument appears to be:\n1. Basic data science products operate on limited, pre-programmed data\n2. These products cannot learn or make decisions beyond their programming\n3. When these products fail to work for darker-skinned users, it's due to technical limitations (e.g., infrared light absorption) or user error, not intentional racism\n4. Therefore, the products themselves are not racist, though technological improvements are needed\n\nThere are some issues with the argument's validity. The student acknowledges that \"Humans are flawed creatures and many hold prejudices and biases against others that might carry over into their work,\" but then doesn't fully address how this affects the creation of \"dumb\" technology. The argument also doesn't fully engage with the concept of material anchors supporting racism even if unintentionally.\n\nThe premises are somewhat explicit, but there are some missing connections. The student doesn't clearly establish the link between intention and racism in technical artifacts. The argument assumes that without intention or learning capability, objects cannot support racist norms.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Needs Improvement**\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nKey sentences related to understanding:\n\n\"As referenced by Liao and Huebner, a black man recorded, with a humorous perspective, a soap dispenser that did not dispense for him but did for his white friend. Also mentioned by them was another black person who found she affected by the camera and how brown skin came out on color film.\"\n\n\"Liao and Huebner think that any data science product that cause such feelings as mentioned above, ones that perpetuate behaviors, associations, or feelings with negativity due to psychological judgments, are rooting in racism and help reinforce racist norm in society.\"\n\nThe student references Liao and Huebner's work and attempts to summarize their position. However, the summary lacks depth and nuance. The concept of \"material anchors\" that appears in the title is not adequately explained. The student's representation of Liao and Huebner's arguments is somewhat oversimplified, and there isn't a detailed engagement with their theoretical framework.\n\nThe student seems to understand the basic examples Liao and Huebner discuss but doesn't dive deep into their theoretical framework about how material objects can maintain or support racist norms. There's limited reference to the text beyond these examples.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Needs Improvement**\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nThe essay is structured with clear sections:\n- Introduction\n- \"The Culprits\" (explains different types of data science products)\n- \"Caught in the Act?\" (discusses examples from Liao and Huebner)\n- \"Err on the Side of Error\" (analyzes technical limitations)\n- \"Let's Recap\" (conclusion)\n\nKey sentences related to analysis:\n\n\"Products that require limited and low data entries run with only so much purview and power. They are not making racist decisions on the spot each time they are operated in a new scenario simply because they lack the ability to do so.\"\n\n\"The camera is operating off a certain data set in its 'mind' that is basically flipped on when a certain threshold is reached – in this case when a certain percentage of the lens or area to be captured in the photo is under a certain percent of visible light.\"\n\n\"Of course, one can claim that the inabilities, or failures, of the data in the product to function as perfectly as they do with any lighter skinned person can itself be racist.\"\n\nThe analysis focuses primarily on the technical limitations of \"dumb\" data science products. The student breaks down examples like motion sensors and cameras to explain how they function and why they might not work for everyone. The analysis is somewhat detailed when it comes to the technical aspects.\n\nHowever, the essay doesn't adequately analyze the philosophical concept of \"material anchors\" or engage deeply with how objects can support social norms regardless of intention. The student dismisses the possibility that technical limitations could still support racist norms without fully engaging with this argument.\n\nThe structure is clear, but the analysis is imbalanced - stronger on technical explanations but weaker on philosophical engagement. The language is generally clear but sometimes informal (\"But perhaps all would say, or think, that it was experienced when interacting with another human being\").\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Needs Improvement** to **Good** (leaning toward Needs Improvement)\n\n## Main Argument and Supporting Points\n\nMain argument: Basic data science products like motion sensors and cameras are not racist or material anchors supporting racism; rather, their failures with darker skin tones are due to technical limitations and projection of human issues onto technology.\n\nSupporting points:\n1. Basic data science products operate on limited, pre-programmed data and cannot \"think\" or make decisions beyond their programming\n2. Technical limitations (e.g., infrared absorption by darker skin) explain failures rather than racist intent\n3. User error may account for some failures\n4. People may project their own insecurities or past experiences with racism onto neutral technologies\n5. While the emotional responses to technology failures are valid, attributing racism to these products is misguided\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\nThe student's argument has several logical issues:\n1. They set up a straw man by implying that Liao and Huebner's argument requires technologies to have intention or consciousness to be racist, when the concept of \"material anchors\" is about how objects perpetuate norms regardless of intention\n2. They acknowledge that humans with biases create these technologies, but don't fully explore how these biases manifest in design decisions\n3. They distinguish between \"dumb\" technology and AI but don't explain why this distinction matters for the concept of material anchors\n4. The argument about technical limitations (e.g., infrared absorption) actually supports the idea that these technologies were designed with lighter skin as the norm, which could be seen as supporting racist norms\n\nThe student's strongest arguments relate to the technical explanations of why certain technologies fail for darker skin. However, they don't connect these explanations back to the philosophical question of whether these failures, regardless of their cause, support racist norms in society.\n\n## Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear structure with defined sections. The flow is logical, moving from introduction to types of data products to examples to analysis to conclusion.\n\nLanguage: The language is generally clear but sometimes informal or imprecise. There are occasional grammatical errors or awkward phrasings (e.g., \"one not positioning themselves correctly\").\n\nExamples: The student uses examples from Liao and Huebner (soap dispenser, cameras) but doesn't introduce any new examples. The analysis of these examples focuses primarily on technical aspects.\n\nFocus: The essay maintains focus on the question, though it narrows the scope to \"dumb\" data science products rather than all data science products. This narrowing is explicit but not fully justified in terms of the philosophical question.\n\n## Addressing the Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the question posed in the title: \"Can data science products be 'material anchors' that support racism?\" The student's answer is \"no\" for basic \"dumb\" data science products.\n\nHowever, the essay doesn't fully engage with the concept of \"material anchors\" and how objects can support social norms regardless of intention. The student focuses more on whether these products are intentionally racist rather than whether they support or maintain racist norms in society.\n\nThe essay also shows limited engagement with the source material (Liao and Huebner), focusing primarily on examples rather than theoretical framework.\n\nOverall assessment: The essay addresses the question but does not engage deeply enough with the philosophical concepts and literature needed to fully answer it."

         "Thesis: The essay presents a clear thesis that directly answers the question. The author argues \"that the company should adopt a causal fairness definition when designing its résumé-screening algorithm\" and specifies that this approach ensures \"protected attributes like race, gender, and age do not directly cause disparities in candidates' chances of being selected.\" The thesis is well-positioned in the introduction and takes a definitive stance on the fairness definition question.\n\n\"In this essay, I argue that the company should adopt a causal fairness definition when designing its résumé-screening algorithm. Specifically, the company should aim to ensure that protected attributes like race, gender, and age do not directly cause disparities in candidates' chances of being selected.\"",
         "Argument Validity: While the essay presents several logical premises, there are significant gaps in the argument structure. The central claim that causal fairness can reconcile statistical fairness definitions is asserted without rigorous demonstration: \"Under these conditions both equalized odds and predictive parity would be mathematically equivalent and reconciles the trade-off between the two fairness definitions.\" This critical claim lacks formal proof or detailed explanation.\n\nThe essay relies heavily on vague descriptions of matching techniques without explaining their implementation: \"The goal of matching is to create comparable pairs of individuals across groups who are similar in all relevant ways except for their group characteristics.\" How exactly this matching would be performed, which specific technique would be used, and how it would resolve the mathematical incompatibility between fairness metrics remains unexplained.\n\nThe argument depends almost entirely on assertions attributed to a single source (Beigang 2023) without adequate citations or engagement with broader literature: \"Beigang (2023) has argued that both definitions are mathematically incompatible when different groups have different base rates of success.\" This limited evidence base undermines the validity of several key premises.\n\nThe conclusion may follow from the stated premises, but many of these premises themselves lack sufficient justification or development.",
         "Understanding: The essay shows basic understanding of fairness concepts but lacks depth and precision. While the definitions of equalized odds and predictive parity are generally accurate, the explanation of causal fairness remains conceptually vague without mathematical formulation or connection to established causal inference frameworks.\n\n\"The causal approach to fairness can be defined as focusing on whether a protected characteristic (race, gender, etc.) has a causal effect on errors or predictive value, beyond its relevance to the task at hand.\"\n\nThe essay does not engage with the substantial literature on algorithmic fairness beyond a single source. No mention is made of counterfactual fairness, which is a prominent causal approach in ML literature, nor of other important fairness definitions like demographic parity or individual fairness. The discussion of matching techniques demonstrates superficial understanding without technical specificity:\n\n\"Applying the matching technique to equalized odds on all relevant factors, false positive and false negative rates should be equal across matched individuals.\"\n\nThis statement glosses over the considerable technical challenges in implementing such matching. The essay would benefit from engaging with canonical works in the field and providing more technically precise explanations.",
         "Analysis, Structure, and Clarity: The essay has a logical structure, progressing from problem definition to proposed solution to defense and limitations. However, the analysis lacks sufficient depth in critical areas.\n\nThe example provided is overly simplistic: \"Suppose two candidates, one male and one female, have identical degrees, work experience, and skills.\" This fails to address the complexity of real-world résumés and doesn't explain how the algorithm would determine if candidates are truly \"identical\" in qualifications.\n\nThe essay identifies potential objections but offers limited solutions: \"One objection for causal fairness is that it requires identifying and controlling for all relevant qualifications, which is practically impossible.\" The response to this objection (\"imperfect matching can still reduce unfairness\") lacks specificity about how this would work in practice.\n\nThe essay correctly breaks down the fairness problem into components but analyzes them at an uneven depth. The practical implementation section is particularly underdeveloped, with little discussion of how causal variables would be identified from résumé data or how unobserved confounders would be handled.\n\nWhile the writing is generally clear, the most technically important sections (explaining how matching reconciles fairness definitions) are the least detailed, suggesting an imbalanced analysis.",

         "This essay presents a clear thesis and logical structure but falls short in argumentative rigor and technical depth. The central weakness is the inadequate explanation of how causal fairness and matching techniques would actually be implemented to resolve the fairness incompatibility problem. The argument relies heavily on a single source without engaging the broader literature. To improve, the essay needs: (1) precise mathematical formulation of causal fairness, (2) detailed explanation of specific matching techniques and their implementation, (3) engagement with multiple sources in the algorithmic fairness literature, and (4) more realistic discussion of practical implementation challenges including unobserved confounders and variable selection.",

         "Hi Nicole,\n\nYou've made a solid attempt at addressing a complex problem in algorithmic fairness. Your thesis is strong and clearly stated, and you maintain a logical structure throughout your essay.\n\nHowever, I need to point out some significant issues that weaken your argument. The most critical problem is how you've handled the technical aspects of causal fairness. You introduce matching techniques as central to your solution, but provide little detail on how they would actually work in practice. For instance, when you write that \"matching techniques to equalized odds on all relevant factors\" would resolve fairness incompatibilities, you don't explain which specific matching methods would be used or how they would be implemented algorithmically.\n\nYour reliance on a single source (Beigang) without engaging the broader literature is also problematic. The field of algorithmic fairness has a rich body of work on causal approaches, including counterfactual fairness, that you don't mention. Your example of comparing \"identical\" male and female candidates oversimplifies the challenge of determining which qualifications are truly comparable across different demographic groups.\n\nFor your next essay, I'd recommend: (1) providing mathematical precision when discussing technical concepts, (2) engaging with multiple sources to situate your argument within existing literature, and (3) addressing practical implementation challenges more realistically, including how to identify relevant variables and handle unobserved confounders.\n\nYour ability to clearly state a thesis and structure an argument shows promise. With more technical precision and deeper engagement with the literature, you could significantly strengthen future work.\n\nBest,\n[Grader]",

         "Let me begin by identifying the main argument and supporting points of the essay:\n\n## Main Argument\nThe essay argues that a company should adopt a causal fairness definition when designing its résumé-screening algorithm to ensure that protected attributes like race, gender, and age do not directly cause disparities in candidates' chances of being selected.\n\n## Supporting Points\n1. Statistical fairness definitions (equalized odds and predictive parity) are mathematically incompatible when different groups have different base rates of success.\n2. The causal approach to fairness focuses on whether protected characteristics have a causal effect on errors or predictive value beyond their relevance to the task.\n3. The causal approach allows for the use of matching techniques to create comparable pairs of individuals across groups to isolate the causal effect of protected characteristics.\n4. Causal fairness aligns with the ethical principle that individuals should be assessed based on job-relevant qualifications rather than irrelevant personal attributes.\n5. While implementing causal fairness has challenges (like identifying all relevant qualifications), even imperfect matching can reduce unfairness.\n\nNow, let me analyze the essay based on each rubric criterion:\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nKey sentences:\n- \"In this essay, I argue that the company should adopt a causal fairness definition when designing its résumé-screening algorithm.\"\n- \"Specifically, the company should aim to ensure that protected attributes like race, gender, and age do not directly cause disparities in candidates' chances of being selected.\"\n- \"This causal approach avoids the consequences of statistical fairness metrics and offers an ethically defensible, context-specific path to fairness that aligns with the company's goal of building a workforce where hiring decisions are driven by job-relevant qualifications, not by other characteristics.\"\n\nThe thesis is clearly stated in the introduction and directly answers the question of what definition of fairness the company should take. The student takes a decisive position by advocating for causal fairness and explains why this approach is superior to other fairness definitions. The thesis is specific and unambiguous.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nKey sentences:\n- \"Beigang (2023) has argued that both definitions are mathematically incompatible when different groups have different base rates of success. This incompatibility shows that current statistical fairness definitions are incomplete because they focus on surface-level disparities rather than examining whether those disparities are causally linked to discrimination.\"\n- \"The causal approach to fairness can be defined as focusing on whether a protected characteristic (race, gender, etc.) has a causal effect on errors or predictive value, beyond its relevance to the task at hand.\"\n- \"Under the causal approach, fairness requires that decisions are not influenced by irrelevant characteristics like race or gender. Thus, current statistical definitions of fairness fail to distinguish between disparities caused by bias and disparities caused by external factors.\"\n\nThe student has laid out several premises:\n1. Statistical fairness definitions (equalized odds and predictive parity) are incompatible when base rates differ.\n2. This incompatibility indicates that statistical definitions focus on surface-level disparities rather than causal relationships.\n3. The causal approach focuses on whether protected characteristics directly influence outcomes beyond their job relevance.\n4. Causal fairness distinguishes between discrimination-caused disparities and external-factor-caused disparities.\n\nThese premises logically lead to the conclusion that causal fairness is a more appropriate definition for the company. The student has explicitly stated the key normative premise that decisions should be based on job-relevant qualifications rather than protected characteristics. \n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the argument could be strengthened:\n- The student mentions Beigang (2023) but does not provide comprehensive citations or a bibliography to verify this source.\n- The explanation of how matching techniques reconcile equalized odds and predictive parity could be clearer and more detailed.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nKey sentences:\n- \"Fairness in algorithmic decision-making refers to the just and equitable treatment of individuals or groups in the selection process. Many definitions of fairness exist, but two dominant statistical approaches have emerged: equalized odds and predictive parity.\"\n- \"Equalized odds requires that error rates -- false positives and false negatives -- be equal across protected groups. Predictive parity requires that, for all selected candidates, the likelihood of actual success on the job is equal across groups.\"\n- \"The causal approach to fairness can be defined as focusing on whether a protected characteristic (race, gender, etc.) has a causal effect on errors or predictive value, beyond its relevance to the task at hand.\"\n\nThe essay demonstrates a good understanding of different fairness definitions in algorithmic decision-making. The student accurately explains equalized odds and predictive parity, as well as the causal approach to fairness. The student also correctly identifies the mathematical incompatibility between different fairness definitions when base rates differ.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas for improvement:\n- The essay relies heavily on Beigang (2023) but does not mention other relevant literature in the field of algorithmic fairness.\n- The explanation of the matching technique could be more detailed.\n- The essay could benefit from a deeper discussion of how causal fairness relates to established fairness frameworks in the literature.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nKey sentences:\n- \"Fairness, in this context, can have multiple definitions, thus, complicating which definition and approach should be used. Further, these statistical definitions can conflict when different groups have different base rates of success.\"\n- \"Consider the résumé screening system the company wants to use for this example. Suppose two candidates, one male and one female, have identical degrees, work experience, and skills. Further, imagine that the algorithm implicitly favors male candidates because historical data shows that more men have been successful in similar jobs.\"\n- \"One objection for causal fairness is that it requires identifying and controlling for all relevant qualifications, which is practically impossible. Résumés are complex, and it is difficult to perfectly match candidates across all dimensions that might affect job performance.\"\n\nStructure:\nThe essay is well-structured with a clear introduction, body paragraphs that develop the argument, and a conclusion. The organization follows a logical progression from defining the problem, proposing a solution (causal fairness), defending the solution, providing examples, addressing potential objections, and concluding.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe student breaks down the problem of fairness in résumé screening into suitable parts: the limitations of statistical fairness definitions, the advantages of causal fairness, practical implementation through matching, and potential objections. The essay provides a concrete example to illustrate how causal fairness would work in practice and addresses objections to demonstrate critical thinking.\n\nClarity:\nThe writing is generally clear and focused. The student uses examples effectively to illustrate abstract concepts, such as the comparison of male and female candidates with identical qualifications.\n\nAreas for improvement:\n- Some paragraphs are quite long and could be broken down for better readability.\n- The explanation of how matching reconciles equalized odds and predictive parity could be clearer.\n- More specific examples of how causal fairness would be implemented could enhance the argument.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good\n\nNow, let me evaluate the essay against the general guidelines for a good essay:\n\n1. Contains a valid argument: Yes, the essay presents a coherent argument for causal fairness with supporting premises and a clear conclusion.\n\n2. Has a clear structure: Yes, the essay follows a logical structure from introduction to conclusion, with distinct sections for defining terms, defending the approach, providing examples, and addressing objections.\n\n3. Employs simple language: Mostly yes, though some technical terms could be explained more clearly for readers unfamiliar with fairness metrics in ML.\n\n4. Uses examples to illustrate points: Yes, the essay includes an example of comparing male and female candidates to illustrate causal fairness.\n\n5. Focuses on a few key points: Yes, the essay focuses on the advantages of causal fairness over statistical fairness definitions and supports this with clear reasoning.\n\n6. Directly answers the question posed: Yes, the essay directly addresses what definition of fairness the company should take and why.\n\nOverall, this is a strong essay that demonstrates a good understanding of fairness in algorithmic decision-making. The student makes a clear argument for causal fairness and supports it with logical reasoning. There are some areas where the argument could be strengthened, particularly in terms of engaging with a broader range of literature and providing more detailed explanations of technical concepts, but these are relatively minor concerns."

         "Let me carefully analyze this essay on the ethics of data science according to the provided rubric and guidelines.\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nKey sentences:\n- \"Algorithms appear to be free from human biases and fallibilities, and as such are often celebrated for their objectivity. However, a closer examination of the processes behind such algorithms demonstrates that this apparent objectivity is an illusion, and that true objectivity is impossible.\"\n- \"Therefore, the criteria for objectivity are not fulfilled and COMPAS is not objective.\"\n- \"However, a closer examination calls this claim into question. The usage of a proxy variable that does not accurately represent the variable of interest (and expresses this failure in a racially discriminatory way) and a design process that, by necessity, relies on subjective value-based decision-making prevents the tool from being objective.\"\n\nThe essay clearly states its thesis that recidivism risk assessment tools like COMPAS are not objective. The thesis directly answers the question posed. The student establishes early that they will argue against the objectivity of these tools and maintains this position throughout the essay. The thesis is decisive and well-articulated.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent - The thesis clearly answers the question and takes a decisive position.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nKey sentences:\n- \"Opponents of the claim that COMPAS is objective agree with its proponents that a tool can be objective if it does not involve subjective decision-making and human biases.\"\n- \"There are several points at which subjective decisions were made and human bias bled into the model: its definition of recidivism, the measurement of relevant characteristics, and the selected interpretation of fairness.\"\n- \"Given that the selected proxy for recidivism is affected by human racial biases, that the training data was influenced by subjectivity at every step of its creation, and that the definition of fairness used when developing COMPAS was based on a subjective decision, the initial criteria for objectivity are not fulfilled.\"\n\nThe essay sets up a clear criterion for objectivity (absence of subjective decision-making and human biases) and then systematically shows how COMPAS fails to meet this criterion through three main points. The premises are explicitly stated and connected to the conclusion. The argument follows a logical structure and avoids fallacies.\n\nThe student anticipates counterarguments (\"Supporters of COMPAS who view it as an objective tool might say...\") and responds to them, strengthening the overall argument. The student identifies the key normative premise that objectivity requires freedom from human bias and subjective decisions.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent - All premises are explicitly stated, the conclusion follows logically, and premises are fully connected to the conclusion.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nKey sentences:\n- \"As Hardt and Recht described, data about relevant characteristics – those given to the model for its training data – was gathered from defendants via surveys.\"\n- \"Barocas and Boyd contrast two perspectives on the algorithm's fairness: one from a critic who identifies a large discrepancy in error rates between Black and white defendants...\"\n- \"In the United States, \"False arrests\" tend to disproportionately affect Black people. A common factor that causes this is racial bias in police systems.\"\n\nThe essay demonstrates a good understanding of the relevant concepts and literature. The student references multiple sources (Jacobs and Wallach, Hardt and Recht, Barocas and Boyd) and accurately summarizes their key points. The concepts of fairness interpretations, proxy variables, and racial bias in the criminal justice system are accurately described.\n\nThe essay puts these concepts into the student's own words rather than relying on quotes. There are no significant misinterpretations evident in the summary of the arguments or the literature.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent - Referenced texts are accurately summarized in the student's own words with no apparent misinterpretations.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nKey sentences:\n- \"There are several points at which subjective decisions were made and human bias bled into the model: its definition of recidivism, the measurement of relevant characteristics, and the selected interpretation of fairness.\"\n- \"Given that the tool's true outcomes are a reinforcement of biases, and not an accurate reflection of reality, it would be prudent to consider ceasing the use of COMPAS altogether until these issues can be resolved.\"\n- \"From this, there are two sources of subjective decisions. The first is the survey itself – ultimately, the question of what to include must be answered by value judgments. The second is from the responses, as there is no way to guarantee that defendants answered every question with perfect accuracy.\"\n\nThe essay has a clear and logical structure. It begins with an introduction that sets up the topic and thesis, presents the main argument against objectivity, provides detailed analysis of specific points, addresses potential counterarguments, and concludes with a summary and policy recommendation.\n\nThe student breaks down the problem into appropriate parts (definition of recidivism, measurement of characteristics, interpretation of fairness) and analyzes each thoroughly. The level of detail is appropriate for the word limit, and the analysis remains focused on the central question of objectivity.\n\nThe essay uses clear language and avoids unnecessary jargon. The structure follows a logical progression that helps the reader follow the argument.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent - The problem is broken down into suitable parts with appropriate detail and focused analysis.\n\n## Main Argument\n\nThe main argument of the essay is that recidivism risk assessment tools like COMPAS are not objective because they involve subjective decision-making and human biases at multiple points in their development and implementation.\n\n## Supporting Points\n\n1. The definition of recidivism as \"a new arrest within two years\" is a proxy measure that reflects racial biases in policing rather than actual criminal behavior.\n\n2. The data collection process for the model's training involves subjective decisions about which characteristics to measure and relies on potentially inaccurate self-reporting.\n\n3. The interpretation of fairness chosen for the model (equal predictive accuracy across racial groups) is just one of multiple valid interpretations and selecting it over others is a subjective value judgment.\n\n4. The claim that these subjective elements are external to the model fails because the value of objectivity lies in accurately reflecting reality, which these biases prevent.\n\n5. True objectivity is impossible in such models because subjective decisions are unavoidable in their design and implementation.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\nThe student's argument that COMPAS is not objective is logically valid. The student establishes clear criteria for objectivity (absence of subjective decision-making and human biases) and then systematically demonstrates how COMPAS fails to meet these criteria through multiple examples.\n\nThe analysis of how arrest data serves as a flawed proxy for criminal behavior is particularly strong, as it draws on literature to show how racial biases in policing can be encoded into the algorithm.\n\nThe discussion of competing fairness definitions is also compelling, as it highlights the inherent subjectivity in choosing one definition over another when they're mathematically incompatible.\n\nThe student effectively anticipates and responds to counterarguments, strengthening the overall case. The argument against the \"external factors\" defense is particularly strong, as it ties objectivity to accuracy in reflecting reality.\n\nThe conclusion that true objectivity may be impossible in such models is a logical extension of the preceding arguments, though it makes a broader claim that could perhaps benefit from additional support.\n\n## Assessment of Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nThe essay has a clear, logical structure that progresses from introduction to thesis, through detailed arguments, counterarguments, and to a conclusion. Each paragraph serves a clear purpose in advancing the overall argument.\n\nThe language is clear and precise, avoiding unnecessary jargon. The essay explains technical concepts like competing fairness definitions in accessible terms.\n\nThe essay uses specific examples from the literature to support its claims, including the discrepancy in false positive rates between Black and white defendants and the competing interpretations of fairness.\n\nThe focus remains squarely on the question of objectivity throughout, with all points directly relating to this central question.\n\n## Addressing the Assigned Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the assigned question: \"Data-driven tools for recidivism risk assessment operationalize recidivism as 'a new arrest within two years.' Proponents of such tools claim that such risk assessment tools are objective. Are they?\"\n\nThe student takes a clear position (these tools are not objective) and provides a detailed, well-supported argument for this position. The essay considers the claims of proponents but systematically demonstrates why these claims fail.\n\nThe student goes beyond a simple yes/no answer to explore the deeper implications of the question, including whether true objectivity is even possible in such contexts.\n\n## Word Count Assessment\n\nWhile I don't have an exact word count, the essay appears to be within the 1500-word limit based on its length. The student uses this space efficiently to develop a thorough argument without unnecessary repetition or tangents.\n\n## Overall Analysis\n\nThis is an excellent essay that presents a clear thesis, develops a logically valid argument, demonstrates strong understanding of the relevant literature, and maintains a clear structure and focus throughout. The student effectively breaks down the problem into appropriate components and analyzes each thoroughly.\n\nThe argument against the objectivity of recidivism risk assessment tools is compelling and well-supported. The student anticipates and responds to counterarguments, strengthening the overall case.\n\nThe essay directly and thoroughly addresses the assigned question, taking a clear position and supporting it with detailed analysis."

         "Let me begin with a thorough analysis of the student essay according to the rubric criteria.\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nKey quotes related to thesis:\n1. \"The firm should define 'fair' based on the stage of the ATS pipeline.\"\n2. \"The definition of fairness employed by the hiring team depends on the group being judged, which directly correlates to early and late stages of the ATS pipeline.\"\n\nThe student presents a clear thesis that answers the question about how a firm should define fairness when using ML and NLP for resume screening. The thesis is directly stated and takes a decisive position: fairness should be defined differently depending on the stage of the applicant tracking system pipeline. This is a specific and nuanced position that guides the rest of the essay.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nThe student structures the argument with explicit premises:\n1. \"Premise 1: Methods of defining and achieving fairness are tools – they have strengths and weaknesses. The two main methods (equalised odds, predictive parity) are considered 'fair' in respect to the context in which they are applied.\"\n2. \"Premise 2: Due to the Kleinberg–Chouldekova Impossibility Theorem, equalised odds and predictive parity are not compatible given differing base rates among groups.\"\n3. \"Premise 3: While causal matching presents an interesting mitigation to the Kleinberg–Chouldekova Impossibility Theorem, resumes alone often do not provide enough information to identify structured and actionable causal variables.\"\n4. \"Premise 4: ATS uses a pipeline whose stages have different contextual requirements that affect which fairness definition is most appropriate.\"\n\nThese premises lead to the conclusion that \"The firm should define 'fair' based on the stage of the ATS pipeline.\" The student explicitly presents these premises before developing them, and they do logically connect to support the conclusion. The student explains why different fairness metrics are appropriate at different stages, based on contextual requirements and limitations of the metrics themselves.\n\nThe student demonstrates the incompatibility of the two fairness methods using Bayes' theorem and explains why alternative approaches (like causal matching) have limitations in this specific context. There's a logical progression from the premises to the conclusion.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nKey quotes demonstrating understanding:\n1. \"For separation, we use 'equalised odds' (EO) to create a situation where each group has the same error rates, such that both the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) are equal across groups.\"\n2. \"For sufficiency, predictive parity (PP) is established by observing the positive predictive value (PPV) across groups.\"\n3. \"From this result, we observe the Kleinberg–Chouldekova Impossibility Theorem in action – for both equalised odds and predictive parity to hold, the base rates must be equal.\"\n\nThe student demonstrates a strong understanding of the core concepts discussed, including equalised odds, predictive parity, and the Kleinberg-Chouldekova Impossibility Theorem. The mathematical formulations are presented to support the explanations. The student clearly articulates the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and explains them in their own words. \n\nThere's a reference to \"Beigang's proposed solution\" which shows familiarity with the literature. The student also demonstrates understanding of how these concepts apply specifically to resume screening and hiring contexts.\n\nOne minor issue is that some equations appear to be incompletely transcribed (noted by \"y.\" in the text), which makes it harder to evaluate the complete understanding of the mathematical formulations.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good to Excellent (leaning toward Excellent but with some incomplete mathematical formulations)\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nKey quotes demonstrating analysis:\n1. \"At earlier stages of the process, ensuring the algorithm does not favour one group over the other based on error rates alone is crucial (equalised odds).\"\n2. \"In later stages, predictive parity is the more suitable as a metric of fairness. By this point in the pipeline, decisions have been supplemented by human-led interviews and background checks.\"\n3. \"Chief among them is the potential for imbalance, wherein one method takes precedence over the other. For example, using two methods (which perform different on the metric of accuracy) may 'cancel out' the perceived benefit of trying to increase selection accuracy with predictive parity.\"\n\nThe essay has a clear structure, beginning with premises, moving to explanation of key concepts, and then developing an argument about how to apply these concepts in different stages of hiring. The student breaks down the problem by:\n1. Explaining the two main fairness approaches\n2. Showing their incompatibility\n3. Considering alternative approaches and their limitations\n4. Analyzing how these approaches apply to different stages of hiring\n5. Identifying potential issues with the recommended approach\n\nThe essay focuses on the specific question at hand and provides appropriate detail on the mathematical formulations and practical implications. The analysis is well-balanced, considering both theoretical aspects and practical applications.\n\nThe student provides a focused analysis of why different fairness definitions are appropriate at different stages of the hiring pipeline, offering specific reasons tailored to each stage.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent\n\n## Main Argument\nThe main argument of the essay is that a firm using ML and NLP for resume screening should define fairness differently depending on the stage of the applicant tracking system (ATS) pipeline. Specifically, equalised odds should be used in earlier stages of the hiring process to avoid systematically disadvantaging any group, while predictive parity is more appropriate in later stages when the pool of candidates is smaller and additional information has been gathered.\n\n## Supporting Points\n1. Fairness metrics (equalised odds and predictive parity) have different strengths and weaknesses, making them appropriate for different contexts.\n2. The Kleinberg-Chouldekova Impossibility Theorem proves that these fairness metrics cannot be simultaneously satisfied when base rates differ between groups.\n3. Alternative solutions like causal matching are limited by the information available in resumes alone.\n4. Different stages of the hiring pipeline involve different contexts and stakeholders, requiring different fairness considerations.\n5. Earlier stages of hiring involve the general population and should focus on equal error rates, while later stages involve a smaller subset where predictive parity is more appropriate.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\nThe argument is generally valid and logically consistent. The student correctly identifies that different fairness metrics serve different purposes and have different limitations. The explanation of the Impossibility Theorem is accurate, though some mathematical formulations appear incomplete in the transcription.\n\nThe connection between the premises and the conclusion is logical. If different fairness metrics have different strengths and cannot be simultaneously satisfied, and if different hiring stages have different requirements, then using different metrics for different stages is a reasonable approach.\n\nOne weakness is that the essay doesn't fully develop potential counterarguments or address all possible objections. For example, it mentions potential drawbacks of using different metrics at different stages but doesn't provide a thorough exploration of how to mitigate these drawbacks.\n\n## Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\nThe essay has a clear structure with explicitly stated premises leading to a conclusion, followed by detailed explanation and analysis. The language is clear and appropriate, using technical terminology accurately.\n\nThe essay does use some examples, particularly when explaining how different fairness metrics would apply to different stages of hiring. However, it could benefit from more concrete examples or case studies to illustrate the practical implications of the proposed approach.\n\nThe focus is maintained throughout on the specific question of how to define fairness in the context of ML/NLP-based resume screening. The student avoids unnecessary digressions and keeps the discussion relevant to the task at hand.\n\n## Addressing the Assigned Topic\nThe essay directly addresses the assigned topic of defining fairness for a firm using ML and NLP for resume screening. It provides a specific recommendation (use different fairness metrics at different stages) with supporting arguments, and it considers limitations and potential issues with this approach.\n\nThe essay demonstrates an understanding of both the technical aspects (fairness metrics, mathematical formulations) and the practical considerations (how these would apply in real-world hiring) relevant to the topic.\n\nOverall, this is a strong essay that demonstrates understanding of the concepts, presents a valid argument, and maintains focus on the assigned topic."

         "# Essay Analysis: Defining Fairness in Hiring Algorithms\n\n## 1. Thesis Analysis\n\nThe thesis of the essay appears to be:\n\n> \"In this essay, I argue that counterfactual fairness should be the guiding principle in the design of machine learning based hiring systems.\"\n\nThis statement directly answers the question of what definition of fairness the company should take. The student further elaborates:\n\n> \"A company should adopt a definition of fairness that is grounded in counterfactual fairness, which ensures applicants are carefully evaluated without the influence of systematic biases embedded in historical hiring practices.\"\n\nThe thesis is clearly stated and takes a decisive position on the question. The student commits to a specific definition of fairness (counterfactual fairness) and maintains this position throughout the essay.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Excellent**\n\n## 2. Argument Validity Analysis\n\nKey normative premises:\n- \"True fairness requires the complete dismantle of structures set in place, that allow for discrimination to persist under the disguise of efficiency and objectivity.\"\n- \"A 'fair' artificial intelligence system is not one that only 'removes race or gender' from the equation, it must account for past discrimination and work to correct it.\"\n\nThe student argues that counterfactual fairness is necessary for addressing algorithmic bias in hiring because:\n1. ML systems learn from historical data that contains biases\n2. These biases perpetuate systemic inequalities if not addressed\n3. Counterfactual fairness ensures equal treatment regardless of protected attributes\n\nThe conclusion (companies should adopt counterfactual fairness) follows from these premises. The student explicitly connects the premises to the conclusion by explaining how counterfactual fairness addresses the problems identified.\n\nHowever, there are some missing premises:\n- The student doesn't fully explicate what counterfactual fairness is in technical terms\n- The essay lacks a clear comparison with alternative fairness definitions\n- While Johnson and Benjamin are cited, their specific arguments aren't always clearly connected to the student's own premises\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good**\n\n## 3. Understanding Analysis\n\nThe student references two key texts:\n- Benjamin (2019) and the concept of the \"New Jim Code\"\n- Johnson (2020) on algorithmic bias and \"garbage in, garbage out\"\n\nExamples of the student's understanding:\n> \"Benjamin (2019) addresses the extent to this critique, by introducing the concept of the New Jim Code. This New Jim Code is no more than a sly way in which apparent neutral technologies encode and perpetuate racial hierarchies.\"\n\n> \"A major concept that Johnson (2020) brings to light is the garbage in, garbage out issue; if an algorithm learns from biased hiring data, its predictions will perpetuate those biases.\"\n\nThe student generally seems to understand the sources referenced, though the summaries are sometimes brief and could be more detailed. There appears to be no major misinterpretation of the texts, though the exposition could be clearer in places.\n\nThe student uses their own words to summarize these concepts rather than relying heavily on direct quotes, which is good. However, the depth of engagement with these sources could be improved.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good**\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity Analysis\n\nThe essay is structured into four main sections:\n1. Defining Fairness in Hiring Algorithms (Introduction)\n2. The Inescapable Reality of Bias in Algorithmic Hiring\n3. Implementing Fairness Beyond the Algorithm\n4. Confronting the Tradeoff Myth and Ethical Responsibilities\n5. The Call for Justice-Oriented Hiring (Conclusion)\n\nThis structure breaks down the problem into suitable parts, moving from defining the issue, to exploring its context, to suggesting solutions and addressing counterarguments.\n\nThe essay's clarity is sometimes impeded by grammatical errors, run-on sentences, and occasional awkward phrasing. For example:\n> \"The impact of a company incorporating a beneficial definition of fairness is often overlooked or questioned rather than thoroughly explained.\"\n\n> \"Counterfactual fairness is an overly complex topic that should be intervened at multiple levels.\"\n\nThere are also some typos and formatting issues that affect readability.\n\nThe level of detail is generally appropriate, though some sections could benefit from more concrete examples or more detailed analysis. The student mentions their personal experience as \"a woman of color,\" which adds a relevant perspective but isn't substantially developed.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good**\n\n## Main Argument Identification\n\nThe main argument of the essay can be structured as follows:\n\n1. Machine learning systems trained on historical hiring data will reproduce biases in that data (\"garbage in, garbage out\")\n2. These biases disproportionately harm marginalized groups (as explained by Benjamin's \"New Jim Code\" concept)\n3. Counterfactual fairness ensures that predictions remain the same regardless of protected attributes\n4. Therefore, companies should adopt counterfactual fairness as their definition of fairness in ML hiring systems\n5. Further, this must be supplemented with human oversight, diverse development teams, and policies that actively seek underrepresented talent\n\n## Supporting Points\n\n1. Historical hiring data reflects past discrimination and biases that should not be perpetuated\n2. Simply removing protected attributes from algorithms is insufficient (due to proxy variables)\n3. There is a false tradeoff between accuracy and fairness; \"accuracy\" based on biased data is not meaningful\n4. Fairness requires ongoing processes and accountability, not just one-time algorithmic adjustments\n5. A justice-oriented approach requires dismantling historical barriers, not just statistical adjustments\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\nThe argument that historical data contains biases that will be reproduced by ML systems is well-supported and logically sound. The student rightly notes that ML systems \"learn from flawed human decisions.\"\n\nThe connection between Benjamin's \"New Jim Code\" concept and the specific problem of hiring algorithms is established, though it could be developed more explicitly.\n\nThe student effectively challenges the notion that fairness and accuracy are in opposition, arguing that \"accuracy\" based on biased data is meaningless. This is a strong point that demonstrates critical thinking.\n\nThe argument about counterfactual fairness, however, lacks technical detail. The student mentions that it \"ensures that individuals are treated the same regardless of socially sensitive attributes\" but doesn't elaborate on how this works mathematically or in practice.\n\nThe essay also asserts that \"true fairness requires the complete dismantle of structures set in place,\" which is a strong claim that could benefit from more support or nuance.\n\nThere's a logical inconsistency in stating that counterfactual fairness \"can provide a necessary solution, regardless of if it is sufficient\" while later arguing that it's essential but \"not enough on its own.\" This suggests some confusion about exactly what role counterfactual fairness plays in the overall solution.\n\n## Structure, Language, and Example Assessment\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear introduction and conclusion with logically organized sections in between. However, transitions between sections could be smoother, and some paragraphs contain multiple ideas that could be better organized.\n\nLanguage: The writing contains numerous grammatical errors, typos, and awkward phrasings that somewhat impede clarity. Examples include:\n- \"This would require human oversight and monitoring in the hiring process and when making hiring decisions. Not only would this ensure fairness at a more justified level, but it would ensure diverse teams are involved in artificial intelligence model development.\"\n- \"There will also always be a different variable or statistic that will make you appear inferior to the next individual, within both human and algorithmic hiring systems.\"\n\nExamples: The essay uses some concrete examples, such as:\n- The exclusion of Black women from leadership positions\n- Gatekeeping mechanisms in education (top universities)\nHowever, more specific examples of how counterfactual fairness works in practice would strengthen the argument.\n\nFocus: The essay maintains focus on the question of defining fairness in ML hiring systems. It doesn't stray into unrelated topics, though it could delve deeper into the specific definition chosen.\n\n## Addressing the Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the question: \"What definition of fairness should the company take, and why?\" The student clearly advocates for counterfactual fairness and provides reasons for this choice.\n\nHowever, the essay could more thoroughly explain:\n1. What counterfactual fairness is in technical terms\n2. How it differs from other definitions of fairness\n3. Why it's superior to alternative definitions\n\nThe \"why\" part of the question is partially addressed through the discussion of bias in historical data and the inadequacy of simply removing protected attributes, but a more systematic comparison with alternative definitions would strengthen the answer.\n\n## Overall Assessment of the Essay Analysis\n\nThe essay presents a clear thesis advocating for counterfactual fairness in ML hiring systems. The argument is generally valid, though it could benefit from more explicit premises and more technical detail about counterfactual fairness itself.\n\nThe student demonstrates understanding of relevant sources and concepts, though the depth of engagement could be improved. The essay's structure is logical, breaking the problem down into appropriate parts, but clarity is sometimes impeded by grammatical errors and awkward phrasing.\n\nThe student directly addresses the question posed and maintains focus throughout. The personal perspective as \"a woman of color\" adds relevance but isn't substantively developed.\n\nStrengths:\n- Clear thesis that directly answers the question\n- Good understanding of how bias manifests in algorithmic systems\n- Effective challenge to the fairness-accuracy tradeoff notion\n\nAreas for improvement:\n- More technical explanation of counterfactual fairness\n- Comparison with alternative fairness definitions\n- Improved grammar and clarity\n- More concrete examples of how the proposed solution would work in practice"

         "Thesis\nThe essay presents a clear and decisive thesis that directly answers the question: \"I argue that the company should adopt the equalized odds parity (separation criterion) as a definition for fairness when implementing a model for screening candidates.\" The author explicitly states why this definition is appropriate: \"This definition of fairness is uniquely suited to the objectives of the company because it balances fairness and merit-based hiring, while also ensuring fair distribution of errors.\" The thesis takes a definitive position on the fairness definition question and establishes the structure for the subsequent arguments.",
         "Argument Validity\nThe essay constructs a logical argument with most premises explicitly stated. The main argument follows from two key premises: \"The Separation Criterion is the most suitable definition of fairness because it reduces systematic discrimination and balances fairness with merit-based hiring.\" The author develops both premises with explanations and examples of how equal error rates prevent discrimination and allow for merit-based selection without artificial quotas.\n\nThe essay also addresses counterarguments: \"Some may argue that the leeway separation criterion gives to merit-based hiring undermines fairness because conceptions of merit are not neutral.\" The rebuttal is reasonable, distinguishing between procedural fairness and outcome justice.\n\nHowever, while the essay thoroughly compares separation criterion with demographic parity, it inadequately addresses why separation criterion is superior to predictive parity. This represents a gap in the logical structure. Additionally, some normative premises about the value of merit could be more explicitly stated.",
         "Understanding\nThe essay demonstrates solid understanding of the three fairness criteria, defining each in the author's own words: \"Demographic Parity (independence criterion) asserts that a model is fair if group membership does not affect the classification outcomes...\" The explanations are accurate and applied appropriately to the hiring context.\n\nThe author shows familiarity with relevant concepts like historical bias in ML models: \"(Johnson, 2020) explains that ML models inherit social patterns reflected in their training data because that data can be historically biased.\" The essay also demonstrates understanding of the Glass Cliff effect and Beigang's distinction between fairness and justice.\n\nHowever, engagement with the referenced literature could be deeper. The citations to Johnson and Beigang are brief and lack substantive analysis. There are no direct quotes from texts, making it difficult to fully assess the accuracy of interpretation.",

The problem is broken down into appropriate components, and the analysis follows a coherent progression.\n\nThe author effectively uses examples to illustrate abstract concepts: \"For instance, if 20% of qualified female candidates are rejected, while only 5% of qualified males are rejected, the model exhibits gender bias.\" Such examples help clarify how fairness criteria operate in practice.\n\nThe analysis of demographic parity's weaknesses is thorough, but the essay lacks comparable depth in analyzing predictive parity. This creates an imbalance in the analytical framework. The essay also contains some minor grammatical errors and typos (e.g., \"arbrbitrary,\" \"fofor\") that occasionally distract from the content.\n\nThe reference to Thomson's trolley problem in the conclusion feels somewhat forced and doesn't clearly connect to the main argument.",

         "You've done a very good job developing a clear, focused argument about fairness definitions in AI hiring systems! Your thesis is excellent—clear, decisive, and directly addresses the question. I particularly appreciated your concrete examples that illustrate how different fairness criteria would operate in practice and your thoughtful consideration of counterarguments.\n\nFor your next essay, I'd recommend two specific improvements. First, make sure you give equal analytical attention to all alternatives you introduce. While you thoroughly compared separation criterion with demographic parity, the comparison with predictive parity was much less developed, creating an imbalance in your argument. Second, deepen your engagement with the scholarly sources you cite. The references to Johnson and Beigang were helpful but brief—expanding on these sources would strengthen your analysis.\n\nOverall, this is a strong essay that demonstrates solid understanding of fairness concepts and presents a coherent, well-structured argument. Your ability to explain complex concepts clearly is impressive!",

         "Let me analyze this essay according to the provided rubric.\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nKey sentences related to thesis:\n- \"I argue that the company should adopt the equalized odds parity (separation criterion) as a definition for fairness when implementing a model for screening candidates.\"\n- \"This definition of fairness is uniquely suited to the objectives of the company because it balances fairness and merit-based hiring, while also ensuring fair distribution of errors.\"\n\nThe student clearly states their thesis in the introduction. They take a definitive position by arguing for a specific fairness definition (equalized odds parity/separation criterion) and briefly explain why this is the best choice. The thesis directly answers the question posed, which asked what definition of fairness the company should take and why.\n\nAssessment: Excellent - The thesis is clearly stated and takes a decisive position on the question.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nKey premises:\n- \"The Separation Criterion is the most suitable definition of fairness because it reduces systematic discrimination and balances fairness with merit-based hiring.\"\n- \"Equal distribution of errors prevents groups of qualified candidates from being disproportionately rejected from the hiring process.\"\n- \"The separation criterion can break this cycle by ensuring that qualified candidates have an equal probability of passing the screening phase and are not falsely labelled as unqualified on account of group membership.\"\n- \"Equalizing error rates instead of the independence criterion's approach of equalizing selection rates ensures that qualified candidates are selected fairly on account of merit rather than solely on group membership.\"\n\nThe student provides a logically structured argument. They start by defining the three main fairness criteria, then argue why the separation criterion is superior based on two main premises: (1) it reduces systematic discrimination, and (2) it balances fairness with merit. The conclusion (that the company should adopt the separation criterion) follows logically from these premises. The student also addresses a counterargument regarding structural bias and provides a rebuttal.\n\nHowever, there are some gaps in the argument. The student doesn't fully explain why equalized odds is better than predictive parity (the third option they mentioned). They focus primarily on comparing separation criterion with demographic parity. Additionally, some normative premises about the value of merit-based hiring could be more explicitly stated.\n\nAssessment: Good - Most premises are explicit, and the conclusion follows logically, but there are some missing explanations regarding the comparison with predictive parity, and some normative premises about the value of merit could be more explicit.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nKey sentences demonstrating understanding:\n- \"Demographic Parity (independence criterion) asserts that a model is fair if group membership does not affect the classification outcomes. Essentially, this definition of fairness aims for equal acceptance rates across all groups.\"\n- \"Predictive Parity (sufficiency criterion) defines fairness as ensuring equal predictive value across groups.\"\n- \"Lastly, the separation criterion identifies fairness as equal false positive and negative rates across groups.\"\n- \"The argument on merit is valid, but not incompatible with the separation criterion. Instead, it suggests that the screening model should not blindly accept conventional definitions of merit and deploy causal fairness approaches.\"\n\nThe student demonstrates a solid understanding of the different fairness criteria by accurately defining them in their own words. They show an understanding of how these criteria might play out in the hiring context and the potential implications of each approach. They also reference some scholarly work (Johnson 2020, Beigang 2023) and concepts like the Glass Cliff effect, showing familiarity with relevant literature.\n\nHowever, there are no direct quotes from textual sources, making it hard to fully assess how accurately they're interpreting the literature they reference. The references to Johnson and Beigang are not developed in much depth.\n\nAssessment: Good - Generally accurate summaries of fairness concepts in the student's own words, though the engagement with referenced texts could be deeper.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nKey sentences demonstrating analysis:\n- \"For instance, if 20% of qualified female candidates are rejected, while only 5% of qualified males are rejected, the model exhibits gender bias. Applying the separation criterion ensures that all genders face the same false rejection rate.\"\n- \"For instance, if the model's screening model is trained on historical data containing fewer qualified candidates of color, the model may falsely predict lower success rates for those candidates.\"\n- \"For instance, if the model has already selected 15% of White candidates, 15% of Latino candidates, and 25% of Black candidates, an additional qualified Black candidate could be falsely rejected because their group has surpassed an artificial quota.\"\n- \"In the example of race and Ivy League graduates, the model could compare White and POC Ivy League graduates, ensuring fair screening.\"\n\nStructure:\nThe essay has a clear structure with an introduction, explanation of fairness definitions, reasoning section with two main arguments, evaluation section addressing counterarguments, and conclusion. The organization helps the reader follow the argument logically.\n\nAnalysis and examples:\nThe student uses concrete examples to illustrate their points, which helps clarify complex fairness concepts. They break down the problem into appropriate parts (definitions of fairness, reasons for their choice, potential objections). The analysis focuses on comparing separation criterion primarily with demographic parity, though the comparison with predictive parity is less developed.\n\nClarity:\nThe language is generally clear, though there are a few minor grammatical errors and typos that don't significantly impact understanding (e.g., \"arbrbitrary\" instead of \"arbitrary\", \"fofor\" instead of \"for\").\n\nLevel of detail:\nFor the word limit (1500 words), the student provides an appropriate level of detail in most sections. However, they could have developed the comparison with predictive parity more thoroughly.\n\nAssessment: Good - The essay has a reasonable breakdown of the problem with good examples, though some parts (especially the comparison with predictive parity) are less thoroughly analyzed than others.\n\nMain Argument of the Essay:\nThe company should adopt the equalized odds parity (separation criterion) as its definition of fairness for resume screening because it best reduces systematic discrimination while balancing fairness with merit-based hiring.\n\nSupporting Points:\n1. The separation criterion ensures equal error rates across demographic groups, preventing qualified candidates from being disproportionately rejected based on group membership.\n2. Equal error rates help break the cycle of historical bias in machine learning algorithms by ensuring all qualified candidates have an equal chance of passing the screening.\n3. Unlike demographic parity (which enforces equal selection rates), the separation criterion allows for merit-based selection while still ensuring procedural fairness.\n4. The separation criterion aligns with a procedural view of fairness rather than outcome-based justice, which is appropriate for a private company's hiring context.\n5. While there are concerns about structural bias in conceptions of merit, these can be addressed through careful implementation rather than rejecting the separation criterion altogether.\n\nCritical Examination:\nThe argument for separation criterion over demographic parity is well-developed and persuasive. The student effectively explains how demographic parity could lead to artificial quotas and potentially the Glass Cliff effect.\n\nHowever, the argument for choosing separation criterion over predictive parity is underdeveloped. The student defines predictive parity but doesn't thoroughly explain why it's less suitable than separation criterion for this context.\n\nThe student addresses a key counterargument about structural bias in merit, which strengthens their position. Their distinction between fairness (procedural) and justice (outcome-oriented) provides a useful framework, though they could develop this point more thoroughly.\n\nThe reference to Thomson's trolley problem at the end seems somewhat forced and doesn't clearly connect to the argument about fairness in hiring.\n\nOverall Assessment:\nThe essay directly addresses the question posed and takes a clear position. It presents a valid argument with logical reasoning and demonstrates understanding of fairness definitions in machine learning. The structure is clear, and examples help illustrate abstract concepts. The primary weakness is the underdeveloped comparison with predictive parity and some minor issues with clarity and grammar. Given the word limit, the essay provides a reasonable level of depth in analyzing the main issues."

         "**Thesis**\n\nThe essay presents a clear and decisive thesis that directly answers the question posed: \"The purpose of this paper is to argue in the dissent, maintaining that data-driven risk assessment tools, such as recidivism predictors, are not objective.\" The thesis takes a definitive position, explaining that \"While these tools may seem objective due to their reliance on statistical models and grounding in quantitative data, I argue it is only such at face value.\" The thesis effectively sets up the subsequent analysis by previewing the main arguments about social biases, subjective assumptions, and measurement errors that undermine objectivity claims.",
         "**Argument Validity**\n\nThe essay presents several key premises that lead to its conclusion:\n1. Objectivity requires \"faithfulness to facts, value-freedom, and absence of personal bias\"\n2. The operationalization of recidivism introduces subjective choices\n3. Arrests are not reliable proxies for criminal activity due to racial bias in policing\n4. The data used in these models reflects biased practices rather than objective facts\n\nThe premises are generally well-connected to the conclusion that recidivism risk assessment tools are not objective. However, some premises lack sufficient evidence or detailed explanation. For example, while the essay states that \"arrests are not necessarily a great proxy for criminal behavior,\" it provides limited empirical support for this claim. Similarly, the assertion that \"the two-year threshold set on defining what recidivism is doesn't capture any long-term behaviour\" is not fully developed with reasoning or evidence.",
         "**Understanding**\n\nThe essay demonstrates a solid understanding of key concepts related to objectivity, measurement, and construct validity. The student accurately explains these concepts in their own words: \"Jacobs and Wallach outline the importance of construct validity, assessing if a measurement accurately captures the intended construct or not.\" The student effectively applies theoretical concepts to the specific case of recidivism assessment, such as distinguishing between \"the construct (the theoretical concept we aim to measure, i.e. recidivism) and the operationalization (the specific way in which we measure it, i.e. 'a new arrest within two years').\" The essay shows good comprehension of different dimensions of validity (content, face, consequential) and how they relate to objectivity claims.",
         "**Analysis, Structure, and Clarity**\n\nThe essay is logically organized into clear sections that break down the problem into suitable parts:\n1. Defining objectivity and its challenges\n2. Examining measurement and construct validity\n3. Analyzing the social construction of data\n4. Addressing counterarguments\n\nThe analysis maintains focus on the central question of objectivity. The student effectively addresses potential counterarguments, strengthening the overall analysis: \"One might argue that recidivism risk assessment models are objective because they are based on mathematical and statistical models expected to be free from human bias. However, this argument overlooks the fact that the data used to train these models is itself biased.\"\n\nWhile the overall structure is strong, some sections could be developed more thoroughly.

Your thesis is clear and decisive, and your analysis of how measurement choices and social biases affect objectivity is particularly strong.\n\nI appreciate how you broke down the different aspects of objectivity and construct validity, applying these concepts effectively to the specific case of recidivism prediction. Your section addressing counterarguments demonstrates critical thinking and strengthens your overall position.\n\nFor future essays, consider incorporating more specific evidence to support your key claims. For example, when discussing how arrests are not reliable proxies for criminal behavior, providing statistics or specific studies would make your argument more compelling. Similarly, your mention of COMPAS could be expanded with more details about how exactly its biases manifest.\n\nOverall, this is strong work that shows a good grasp of the philosophical concepts and their application to a real-world policy issue.

         "Let me carefully analyze this essay according to the rubric criteria.\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nKey sentences related to thesis:\n- \"The purpose of this paper is to argue in the dissent, maintaining that data-driven risk assessment tools, such as recidivism predictors, are not objective.\"\n- \"While these tools may seem objective due to their reliance on statistical models and grounding in quantitative data, I argue it is only such at face value.\"\n- \"This is the case as the data itself is based in social biases, subjective assumptions, and measurement errors that serve to undermine any trace of objectivity.\"\n\nThe essay has a clearly stated thesis that directly answers the question posed (\"Are they [recidivism risk assessment tools] objective?\"). The thesis takes a decisive position that these tools are not objective and previews the main arguments to support this position. The thesis appears early in the essay and effectively sets up the subsequent analysis.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent - The thesis clearly states the student's position and directly answers the question.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nKey premises of the argument:\n1. Objectivity in data science can be defined as \"(1) faithfulness to facts, (2) value-freedom, and (3) absence of personal bias\"\n2. The operationalization of recidivism as \"a new arrest within two years\" involves subjective choices that introduce bias\n3. Arrests are not a reliable proxy for criminal activity due to systematic racial bias in policing\n4. Data used to train these models reflects biased policing practices rather than objective facts\n5. The models fail to meet key criteria for construct validity\n\nThe conclusion is that recidivism risk assessment tools are not objective despite claims to the contrary.\n\nThe argument appears valid as the conclusion does follow from the premises. The student explicitly states most of the premises and shows how they connect to the conclusion. The premises address both the technical aspects (measurement errors, construct validity) and social aspects (social construction of data, biases in policing) that undermine objectivity claims.\n\nHowever, there are some issues with how thoroughly some premises are developed. For instance, while the student mentions that arrests are not a reliable proxy for criminal behavior, they don't provide specific evidence or statistics to substantiate this claim beyond referencing racial profiling.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - Most premises are explicitly stated and connected to the conclusion, but some could be more thoroughly developed with evidence.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nKey sentences demonstrating understanding:\n- \"The process of the operationalization, making the measurement, inherently involves assumptions and choices that are likely to introduce some sort of bias.\"\n- \"Jacobs and Wallach outline the importance of construct validity, assessing if a measurement accurately captures the intended construct or not.\"\n- \"As Hardt and Recht point out, the process of turning real-world phenomena into numerical data (quantization) involves choices that can introduce bias.\"\n\nThe student demonstrates a solid understanding of the key concepts related to objectivity, measurement, and construct validity. They reference relevant authors (Jacobs and Wallach, Hardt and Recht) and accurately summarize their ideas in the student's own words. The student also effectively applies these concepts to the specific case of recidivism risk assessment.\n\nThe essay shows a good grasp of different dimensions of construct validity (content validity, face validity, consequential validity) and explains how each relates to the question of objectivity. The student also demonstrates understanding of how social bias impacts data collection and model training.\n\nThere are no apparent misinterpretations of the referenced texts, though the essay could benefit from more direct engagement with specific readings from the course.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - Generally accurate summaries of concepts in the student's own words, with no significant misunderstandings.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nThe essay is structured into clear sections:\n1. Introduction and thesis\n2. Defining objectivity and its challenges in data science\n3. The role of measurement and construct validity\n4. Social construction of data and its implications\n5. Addressing counterarguments\n6. Conclusions\n\nThe problem is broken down into suitable parts, with the student analyzing different aspects of objectivity in relation to recidivism risk assessment tools. The analysis focuses on key points such as the operationalization of recidivism, the validity of measurements, and the social construction of data.\n\nThe level of detail is generally appropriate, though some sections could be developed more fully. For example, the discussion of COMPAS mentions racial disparities but could provide more specific details about how these disparities manifest.\n\nThe analysis is focused and relevant to the thesis. The student effectively connects theoretical concepts to the specific case of recidivism risk assessment tools. The inclusion of a section addressing counterarguments strengthens the overall analysis.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - Reasonable breakdown of the problem into suitable parts, though some aspects could be analyzed more thoroughly.\n\n## Main Argument and Supporting Points\n\nMain argument: Data-driven recidivism risk assessment tools are not objective because they are based on data that reflects social biases, subjective assumptions, and measurement errors.\n\nSupporting points:\n1. The operationalization of recidivism as \"a new arrest within two years\" introduces bias by assuming arrests are a reliable proxy for criminal behavior.\n2. The data used to train these models is generated through policing practices that are influenced by systemic racism and other biases.\n3. The models fail to meet key criteria for construct validity, including content validity and consequential validity.\n4. The process of quantization (turning real-world phenomena into numerical data) involves subjective choices that can introduce bias.\n5. While the models may be mathematically well-structured and consistent, this consistency does not guarantee objectivity if the underlying measurements are flawed.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\nThe student's arguments are generally logically consistent and valid. The premise that arrests are not a reliable proxy for criminal behavior due to racial bias in policing is well-established in the literature, though the essay could provide more specific evidence to support this claim.\n\nThe discussion of construct validity is particularly strong. The student effectively distinguishes between different aspects of validity (content, consequential, face) and explains how recidivism risk assessment tools fall short in each area.\n\nThe section addressing counterarguments demonstrates critical thinking and strengthens the overall argument. The student acknowledges potential objections and provides reasoned responses.\n\nThere are some areas where the arguments could be stronger. The essay mentions that the two-year threshold for defining recidivism is \"arbitrary in nature\" but doesn't fully explain why this is problematic or what alternatives might be more valid. Additionally, while the essay mentions COMPAS as an example, it could provide more detailed analysis of how this specific tool exemplifies the issues discussed.\n\n## Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear structure with a logical flow of ideas. The introduction sets up the thesis, followed by sections that develop different aspects of the argument, and a conclusion that summarizes the key points.\n\nLanguage: The language is generally clear and appropriate for an academic essay. The student effectively uses technical terms related to data science and validity while explaining their meanings.\n\nExamples: The essay includes some examples, such as mentioning COMPAS and discussing how black individuals are more likely to be arrested for minor offenses. However, the essay could benefit from more specific examples and evidence to support its claims.\n\nFocus: The essay maintains a clear focus on the question of whether recidivism risk assessment tools are objective. All sections contribute to answering this central question.\n\n## Addressing the Assigned Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the assigned question: \"Data-driven tools for recidivism risk assessment operationalize recidivism as 'a new arrest within two years.' Proponents of such tools claim that such risk assessment tools are objective. Are they?\"\n\nThe student takes a clear position (that these tools are not objective) and provides a reasoned argument to support this position. The essay effectively analyzes how the operationalization of recidivism and the social construction of data undermine claims of objectivity.\n\nOne area where the essay could more directly address the question is by examining more closely the specific operationalization mentioned in the question (\"a new arrest within two years\"). While the essay does discuss this operationalization, it could provide more detailed analysis of why this specific definition is problematic and how it affects the objectivity of the resulting assessments.\n\n## Word Count Considerations\n\nThe word limit for the essay is 1500 words. The essay appears to stay within this limit while still covering the key aspects of the question. Given this constraint, the level of engagement with the literature and the depth of analysis are reasonable, though as noted earlier, some points could be developed more fully with specific evidence.\n\n## AI Disclaimer Consideration\n\nThe student discloses using AI assistance for creating an outline and for writing part of the conclusion. This level of AI use is openly acknowledged, which is appropriate. However, it does raise some questions about the originality of the work, especially for the conclusion section. Since the student acknowledges this use, it should be factored into the assessment, particularly for sections the student identifies as AI-generated.\n\n## Overall Assessment Summary\n\nStrengths:\n- Clear thesis that directly answers the question\n- Good understanding of key concepts related to objectivity, measurement, and validity\n- Logical structure with appropriate breakdown of the problem\n- Effective consideration of counterarguments\n\nAreas for improvement:\n- Some claims could be supported with more specific evidence\n- Some sections (particularly on the two-year threshold and COMPAS example) could be developed more fully\n- The conclusion is partially AI-generated, which affects the assessment of the student's own analytical skills\n\nGiven these considerations, the essay demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and makes a valid argument, though with some room for improvement in terms of evidence and development of certain points."

Thesis\n\nRelevant quotes:\n- \"I will argue about, and mention fairness in terms of sufficiency and separation, which are analogous to Beigang's paper on fairness and equalized odds and predictive parity respectively. I will argue from the side of sufficiency by outlining the serious flaws that arise from relying on separation as fairness.\"\n- \"Based on the serious flaws seen in separation, it is easy to conclude that separation is not a viable option in practical applications where there is little data; however, I do not support blindly using sufficiency as the only alternative model for fairness.\"\n\nThe essay presents a thesis in the introduction that states the author will argue in favor of sufficiency over separation as a fairness metric for machine learning in résumé screening. The thesis is somewhat clearly stated but could be more explicit about the precise position and why it matters. The author ultimately takes a somewhat nuanced position by arguing that sufficiency is better than separation but still has its own flaws that need to be considered.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - The thesis is present but could be more explicitly stated and decisively positioned.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nRelevant quotes:\n- \"Out of all the issues with choosing separation, the concern about having enough data is the largest problem. Separation is data heavy and requires significantly more data than is required for sufficiency.\"\n- \"Separation seeks to have better representation of groups that often have a lower percentage in total representation, but models based on separation can be heavily skewed if they are based on less data from these smaller minorities within a protected category.\"\n- \"In the event there is misclassification for the separation model, those who are misclassified either are significantly aided by falling into a group that has a higher rate of flagging in this résumé example, or they are significantly hindered by being miscategorized as being in a group that has a lower rate of résumé flagging.\"\n\nThe main premises of the argument are:\n1. Separation requires more data than sufficiency to be effective\n2. Separation has different predictive power across groups\n3. Separation is problematic with misclassification and overlapping groups\n4. Sufficiency provides equal predictive power across different protected categories\n\nThe conclusion is that sufficiency is more practical and fair in real-world applications, especially with limited data. The argument has explicit premises that connect logically to the conclusion. The author provides reasons why separation is problematic and shows how sufficiency avoids these problems. However, the relationship between some premises and the conclusion could be more explicitly connected.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - Most premises are explicit and the key normative premise (sufficiency is fairer in practical applications) is present, but the connections between some premises and the conclusion could be stronger.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nRelevant quotes:\n- \"Sufficiency is a version of fairness that is based on having equal prediction power across different protected categories people fall into.\"\n- \"The separation definition of fairness is based more on having similar prevalence or representation in a nominal sense, but allowing for different rates of acceptance between these protected categories.\"\n- \"I will argue about, and mention fairness in terms of sufficiency and separation, which are analogous to Beigang's paper on fairness and equalized odds and predictive parity respectively.\"\n\nThe essay demonstrates a good understanding of the concepts of sufficiency and separation as fairness metrics. The author correctly describes the key differences between these approaches and their implications. The reference to \"Beigang's paper\" suggests familiarity with relevant literature, though more specific citations would strengthen this aspect. The explanations are in the student's own words, showing comprehension of the material. There are no major misinterpretations evident, though some nuances of the fairness definitions could be more precisely articulated.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - The essay demonstrates understanding of the key concepts in the student's own words, though there could be more precise articulation of some aspects of the fairness definitions.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nRelevant quotes:\n- \"The Difference Between Separation and Sufficiency\" (section heading)\n- \"Why Separation Doesn't Work\" (section heading)\n- \"Overall Assessment\" (section heading)\n\nThe essay has a clear structure with distinct sections that build the argument logically. It starts with definitions, then presents arguments against separation, and finally provides an overall assessment. The analysis breaks down the problem of fairness in machine learning for résumé screening by considering different definitions of fairness and their practical implications. The author focuses on a few key points (data requirements, predictive power, misclassification) and develops them with appropriate detail. \n\nThe essay maintains good focus throughout, though some parts of the analysis could be more thorough. For example, the discussion of misclassification and overlapping groups raises important points but could be developed with more concrete examples or implications. The language is generally clear, though some sentences are complex and could be simplified for greater clarity.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - The essay has a reasonable breakdown of the problem with a logical structure, though some parts of the analysis could be more thorough and balanced.\n\n## Main Argument\n\nThe main argument of the essay is that sufficiency is a better fairness metric than separation for machine learning algorithms in résumé screening, particularly in practical applications with limited data.\n\n## Supporting Points for the Main Argument:\n\n1. Separation requires more data than sufficiency, making it impractical in many real-world scenarios with limited data for minority groups.\n2. Separation can lead to biased predictions when applied to smaller minority groups with less available data.\n3. Separation creates problems with misclassification and overlapping protected categories.\n4. Sufficiency maintains equal predictive power across different protected categories, focusing on maximizing overall utility (success/happiness in jobs).\n5. While sufficiency has its own limitations in potentially perpetuating existing biases, it is still more practically viable than separation.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments:\n\nThe argument that separation requires more data is presented as factual but could benefit from more explanation of why this is the case. The logical connection is made, but the underlying technical reason could be strengthened.\n\nThe concern about different predictive powers across groups in separation is well-articulated and logically sound. This is a central and strong part of the argument.\n\nThe discussion of misclassification provides a valid concern but could benefit from a more detailed explanation of how this problem manifests specifically in the context of résumé screening.\n\nThe claim that sufficiency provides equal predictive power is supported by the definition provided earlier, creating a logical connection between the definition and the argument.\n\nThe final nuanced position acknowledges limitations of both approaches, which demonstrates critical thinking, but could more clearly articulate what a better approach might look like rather than just pointing out flaws in both models.\n\n## Assessment of Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus:\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear and logical structure that builds the argument progressively. The use of section headings helps organize the content effectively.\n\nLanguage: The language is generally clear but sometimes verbose. Some sentences are complex and could be simplified for greater clarity.\n\nExamples: The essay is somewhat abstract and could benefit from more concrete examples illustrating how separation and sufficiency would work in specific résumé screening scenarios. This would make the theoretical distinctions more tangible.\n\nFocus: The essay maintains good focus on the central question of which fairness definition is better for résumé screening. It does not wander into unrelated topics.\n\n## How well the essay addresses the assigned question:\n\nThe essay directly addresses the question of fairness in machine learning for résumé screening, specifically focusing on the comparison between sufficiency and separation as fairness metrics. It takes a clear position on which approach is better while acknowledging limitations, which shows nuanced thinking appropriate for a philosophy essay. The essay could have engaged more with specific literature on the topic and provided more concrete examples to illustrate the practical implications of these different fairness definitions.\n\nIn terms of word count, the essay appears to be within the 1500-word limit, allowing for reasonable depth of engagement with the topic given the constraints."

         "Thesis: The essay presents a strong, clearly articulated thesis that takes a decisive position on the issue. The author argues that \"The perceived objectivity of data science, combined with biased data, creates data science products with racist material anchors embedded in the design.\" The thesis is further developed by explaining how \"the illusion of neutrality in artificial intelligence and the outsourcing of accountability allow these material anchors to evolve into 'oppressive things' that perpetuate racism and uphold discriminatory power structures.\" This thesis effectively frames the subsequent analysis and provides a clear perspective on the topic.",
         "Argument Validity: The essay presents a valid argument with explicitly stated premises that logically connect to the conclusion. Key premises include: (1) data science is perceived as objective; (2) machine learning relies on biased historical data; (3) material anchors reflect and shape biases; and (4) the assumption of neutrality allows for outsourcing accountability. These premises logically lead to the conclusion that data science creates racist material anchors that perpetuate discrimination.\n\nThe author strengthens their argument with relevant examples: \"a facial recognition system may have higher error rates for darker-skinned people of color as a result of poor and unrepresentative data\" and \"the COMPAS risk assessment tool has been criticized for producing biased results that are then applied to the physical world through the disproportionate incarceration of Black defendants.\" These examples effectively illustrate the theoretical concepts and enhance the argument's persuasiveness.\n\nThere are no significant logical fallacies, and the author acknowledges potential counterarguments when noting \"potential tradeoffs when modifying systems to be equitable and corrective, particularly with accuracy or predicting outputs methodologically.\"",

Rather, material anchors are bidirectional and both reflect and actively shape biases.\" The author also accurately represents Benjamin's work: \"These racist biases serve as anchors for social practices and, as Benjamin notes, make 'habituated biases seem natural.'\"\n\nThe student effectively integrates these concepts into their own argument without misinterpretation and without excessive quotation, demonstrating genuine comprehension of the source material.",

         "Let me start by analyzing the essay according to the rubric, identifying key aspects for each criterion.\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nKey quotes related to the thesis:\n- \"The perceived objectivity of data science, combined with biased data, creates data science products with racist material anchors embedded in the design.\"\n- \"There is a false assumption that data is objective, and when system designers do not actively evaluate their data systems, this biased data can perpetuate discriminatory practices and reinforce existing power structures.\"\n- \"Next, I will argue that the illusion of neutrality in artificial intelligence and the outsourcing of accountability allow these material anchors to evolve into 'oppressive things' that perpetuate racism and uphold discriminatory power structures.\"\n\nThe essay has a clearly stated thesis that is presented in the introduction. The author argues that the perceived objectivity of data science, combined with biased data, creates data science products with racist material anchors embedded in the design. They further argue that when these systems are viewed as neutral and accountability is outsourced, these material anchors become oppressive and perpetuate racism. The thesis is decisive and addresses an important issue in the philosophy of technology and artificial intelligence.\n\nPreliminary assessment for Thesis: **Excellent**\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nKey premises and conclusions in the argument:\n- Premise 1: Data science is often perceived as objective and neutral\n- Premise 2: Machine learning systems rely on historical data that is often biased or unrepresentative\n- Premise 3: Material anchors (physical manifestations of bias) both reflect and shape biases\n- Premise 4: The assumption of neutrality in AI allows for the outsourcing of accountability\n- Conclusion: These factors combine to create data science products with racist material anchors that perpetuate discrimination and uphold power structures\n\nThe argument is generally valid. The premises are explicitly stated and the conclusion follows logically from them. The author makes clear connections between the premises and conclusion, explaining how the perception of objectivity combined with biased data leads to racist outcomes.\n\nThe author also provides examples to illustrate their points, such as facial recognition systems with higher error rates for darker-skinned people, the COMPAS risk assessment tool, and credit scoring algorithms. These examples strengthen the argument by showing how the theoretical concepts manifest in real-world applications.\n\nThere don't appear to be any significant logical fallacies. The author acknowledges potential tradeoffs when modifying systems to be more equitable, showing they have considered counterarguments.\n\nPreliminary assessment for Argument Validity: **Good** to **Excellent**\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nKey quotes demonstrating understanding:\n- \"Material anchors, as defined by Liao and Huebner, are physical manifestations of bias. Material anchors 'are aspects of the physical world, which generate intrapersonal and interpersonal forms of stability in social spaces, by shaping patterns of association, behavior, and imagining,' (Liao and Huebner, 10-11).\"\n- \"In Benjamin's article, he references Virginia Eubank's point that similar to humans, machines base their learning on existing data and cognition.\"\n- \"These racist biases serve as anchors for social practices and, as Benjamin notes, make 'habituated biases seem natural,' (Benjamin, 3).\"\n\nThe essay shows a good understanding of the referenced texts, with accurate summaries of concepts like material anchors from Liao and Huebner, and ideas from Benjamin's work. The author uses their own words to explain these concepts and integrate them into their argument, rather than relying too heavily on quotes. They correctly attribute ideas to their sources and seem to have a clear grasp of the material.\n\nThere are no apparent misinterpretations of the referenced texts. The author has successfully applied the concepts to their analysis of bias in data science.\n\nPreliminary assessment for Understanding: **Excellent**\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nThe essay has a clear structure:\n- Introduction that states the thesis and outlines the approach\n- Discussion section that defines key concepts (racism, material anchors, oppression)\n- Analysis of how data science systems can be biased\n- Illustration of how these biases manifest as material anchors\n- Discussion of how the illusion of neutrality and outsourcing of accountability allow these material anchors to become oppressive\n- Examples of racist material anchors in systems like facial recognition, credit scoring, and risk assessment\n- Discussion of the responsibility of system designers\n- Conclusion that summarizes the key points\n\nThe author breaks down the problem into suitable parts and analyzes each with an appropriate level of detail. The analysis is focused on the key aspects of the issue, and the author makes connections between theoretical concepts and real-world examples.\n\nHowever, there are some issues with the writing itself. The essay contains numerous typos and formatting errors (like repeated syllables \"oftften\", \"objbjective\", etc.) that sometimes make it difficult to read. These don't necessarily affect the quality of the analysis but do impact clarity.\n\nPreliminary assessment for Analysis, Structure, and Clarity: **Good**\n\n## Main Argument and Supporting Points\n\nThe main argument of the essay is that data science products, despite being perceived as objective, can contain racist material anchors embedded in their design due to biased data. When combined with the illusion of neutrality and the outsourcing of accountability, these material anchors evolve into \"oppressive things\" that perpetuate racism and uphold discriminatory power structures.\n\nSupporting points:\n1. Data science is often perceived as objective and neutral, creating a false sense of security about the fairness of its outputs.\n2. Machine learning systems are based on historical data that is often biased, unrepresentative, and shaped by historical inequality.\n3. Material anchors (physical manifestations of bias) both reflect and actively shape biases in a bidirectional relationship.\n4. The assumption of neutrality in AI allows decision-makers to validate discriminatory actions under a false sense of objectivity.\n5. The outsourcing of accountability allows machines to act as political entities without appropriate oversight, insulating decision-makers from blame.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\nThe author's arguments are generally valid and logically consistent. They establish clear connections between the perception of objectivity in data science, the use of biased data, and the creation of racist material anchors.\n\nThe argument about material anchors is well-supported by references to Liao and Huebner's work, and the author correctly notes the bidirectional nature of these anchors in both reflecting and shaping biases.\n\nThe discussion of how the assumption of neutrality and the outsourcing of accountability contribute to the problem is also logically sound. The author effectively shows how these factors allow biased systems to operate without adequate scrutiny or correction.\n\nThe examples provided (facial recognition, COMPAS, credit scoring) are relevant and well-chosen to illustrate the concepts being discussed. They help to ground the theoretical arguments in real-world applications.\n\n## Assessment of Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear and logical structure, with an introduction that outlines the approach, a discussion section that covers the key aspects of the argument, and a conclusion that summarizes the main points. The flow of ideas is generally good, although there are some areas where the transitions could be smoother.\n\nLanguage: The language used is generally appropriate for an academic essay, although there are numerous typos and formatting errors that affect readability. The author uses technical terms correctly and explains them adequately.\n\nExamples: The essay uses several strong examples to illustrate the theoretical concepts, which enhances the persuasiveness of the arguments. The examples of facial recognition systems, the COMPAS risk assessment tool, and credit scoring algorithms effectively demonstrate how biased data science can create racist material anchors.\n\nFocus: The essay stays focused on the main argument throughout and doesn't drift into unrelated topics. Each section contributes to the overall thesis and builds upon previous points.\n\n## How Well the Essay Addresses the Topic\n\nWithout knowing the specific assigned question or topic, it's difficult to assess how well the essay addresses it. However, based on the content and structure, it appears that the essay is responding to a prompt about bias, objectivity, and racism in data science or artificial intelligence.\n\nThe essay provides a comprehensive analysis of how data science products can embed and perpetuate racism through material anchors, which seems to be directly addressing the central issue. The author also discusses the philosophical implications of these technologies and their impact on society, which would be appropriate for a philosophy and public policy course.\n\n## Word Count Assessment\n\nThe essay seems to be within the 1500-word limit, though I can't make an exact count. It provides enough depth to explore the key concepts and support the arguments, without becoming overly verbose or including unnecessary content.\n\n## Overall Analysis\n\nThe essay presents a strong thesis about how the perceived objectivity of data science, combined with biased data, creates data science products with racist material anchors. The arguments are generally valid and well-supported with examples and references to relevant literature.\n\nThe author demonstrates a good understanding of the concepts they're discussing, particularly material anchors and their role in perpetuating bias. The structure is clear and logical, with appropriate breakdown of the problem into key components.\n\nThe main weakness is in the writing itself, with numerous typos and formatting errors that affect readability. These don't necessarily impact the quality of the arguments but do detract from the overall clarity of the essay.\n\nIn terms of the rubric, the essay would rate highly on thesis, argument validity, and understanding, with some deductions for clarity issues due to the typos and formatting errors."

         "Let me work through a thorough analysis of this student essay based on the rubric and instructions.\n\n## 1. Thesis Analysis\n\nKey sentences related to the thesis:\n- \"In this essay, y, I argue that the company should adopt equalized odds as its fairness metric because it mitigates disparities in hiring without erasing historical nuance.\"\n- \"Predictive parity, y, on the other hand, might seem appealing because it ensures that difffferent groups are hired at the same success rate, but that success rate is already built on biased hiring practices.\"\n- \"This paper breaks down what fairness actually means in hiring, why equalized odds is the better option, and how Beigang's (2023) critique of fairness metrics—especially around causal reasoning and decontextualization—can push companies to go beyond surface-level fixes.\"\n\nThe thesis is clearly stated early in the essay and takes a decisive position: that equalized odds is a better fairness metric than predictive parity for hiring algorithms. The student does acknowledge limitations of their preferred approach but maintains a clear stance. The thesis directly answers what appears to be the prompt question about which fairness metric a company should adopt.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent. The thesis is clearly stated and takes a decisive position on the question.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity Analysis\n\nMain argument: Equalized odds is a better fairness metric for hiring algorithms than predictive parity because it reduces discriminatory patterns instead of reinforcing them, better preserves historical context, and aligns with legal/ethical standards.\n\nSupporting points:\n1. Predictive parity assumes past hiring data is fair when it isn't, while equalized odds prevents historical bias from dictating new hiring decisions\n2. Equalized odds preserves historical nuance better than predictive parity by ensuring fair consideration rather than manipulating outcomes\n3. Equalized odds aligns better with anti-discrimination laws and regulations\n4. Neither approach is perfect, but equalized odds avoids the major flaw of treating biased data as neutral\n5. Fairness requires more than statistical approaches - it requires interrogating values embedded in hiring\n\nKey premises:\n- Hiring data contains historical biases\n- Fairness metrics based on past success rates without addressing why disparities exist perpetuate discrimination\n- Equalized odds ensures similar false positive and false negative rates across demographic groups\n- Predictive parity ensures similar success rates for candidates who are selected\n- Equal treatment in hiring decisions should not reinforce past discrimination\n\nThe premises are generally explicitly stated, and the conclusion does follow logically from them. The student articulates both the normative premise (that fair hiring shouldn't reinforce past discrimination) and factual premises about how the different metrics work. The connection between premises and conclusion is clear - if historical data is biased (premise) and predictive parity bases its calculations on that data without questioning it (premise), then it will perpetuate discrimination (conclusion), whereas equalized odds avoids this particular problem.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good to Excellent. Most premises are explicit, and the conclusion follows logically from them. The key normative premise about what constitutes fairness is present. The connection between premises and conclusion is clear, though there could be a more systematic presentation of the argument structure.\n\n## 3. Understanding Analysis\n\nReferences to literature:\n- \"But as Beigang (2023) argues, AI fairness often suffffers from gross decontextualization—meaning it's treated as an abstract math problem instead of something tied to real-world histories of discrimination.\"\n- \"Beigang critiques fairness metrics for their tendency to flatten historical context, arguing that fairness should not just be about balancing error rates but also about understanding the causal impact of sensitive attributes like race or gender.\"\n- \"Beigang warns that fairness metrics often overgenerate unfairness, meaning they sometimes flag disparities that aren't necessarily meaningful.\"\n\nThe essay references Beigang (2023) multiple times and accurately summarizes key points from that source in the student's own words. The student demonstrates understanding of both the technical concepts (equalized odds, predictive parity) and the critical perspective that Beigang brings. There are no obvious misinterpretations, and the student avoids excessive quotation, instead putting ideas in their own words.\n\nThe essay shows solid understanding of the technical definitions of both fairness metrics and their implications:\n- \"Equalized odds ensures that false positive and false negative rates are equal across demographic groups, preventing one group from being disproportionately rejected or falsely accepted.\"\n- \"Predictive parity ensures that once a candidate is selected, their probability of being \"successful\" at the job is the same across groups.\"\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good to Excellent. The student accurately summarizes referenced texts in their own words, demonstrates understanding of key concepts, and shows no significant misinterpretations.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity Analysis\n\nStructure:\n- Introduction (presents thesis and overview)\n- What Does It Mean for a Hiring Algorithm to Be Fair? (defines key terms and concepts)\n- Why Equalized Odds is the Better Choice (presents three main arguments)\n- The Limitations of Equalized Odds & How to Fix Them (addresses weaknesses)\n- Reframing the Problem (raises deeper questions about what fairness means)\n- Conclusion (summarizes argument and broader implications)\n\nThe essay has a clear and logical structure. It breaks down the problem into suitable parts - defining the metrics, comparing them, addressing limitations, and considering broader context. The analysis is focused and maintains appropriate level of detail for most sections.\n\nKey strengths in analysis:\n- Provides clear definitions of both fairness metrics\n- Offers a concrete example of how predictive parity can perpetuate bias: \"TaTake a hiring model trained on historical data from a tech company where only 20% of past hires were women due to implicit bias...\"\n- Explicitly discusses the causal reasoning issue raised by Beigang\n- Considers practical implications (legal and ethical standards)\n\nSome issues with analysis:\n- The \"How to Fix Them\" section is underdeveloped - it mentions involving AI ethicists but doesn't fully explain how to address deeper structural inequalities\n- The \"Reframing the Problem\" section raises good questions but doesn't fully develop answers\n- Some sentences contain typos or formatting issues (e.g., \"TaTake\", \"difffferent\"), which slightly impact clarity\n- The essay sometimes repeats points rather than developing new ones\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good. The problem is broken down into suitable parts with appropriate structure. Some parts (especially the arguments in favor of equalized odds) are analyzed more thoroughly than others (such as the limitations and solutions).\n\n## Additional Analysis\n\nFocus and relevance:\nThe essay stays focused on the assigned question, which appears to be about choosing between fairness metrics for a company's hiring algorithm. It directly answers this question with a clear position and supporting arguments.\n\nUse of examples:\nThe essay includes a concrete example of how predictive parity could perpetuate bias in a tech company's hiring. This helps illustrate the abstract concept. However, the essay could benefit from more examples, particularly when discussing how equalized odds might work in practice.\n\nLanguage:\nThe language is generally clear and accessible. Technical terms are defined in plain language. There are some typos and formatting issues (e.g., \"difffferent\", \"TaTake\", \"WoWomen\") that slightly impact readability.\n\nWord limit:\nThe essay appears to be close to the 1500-word limit. Given this constraint, the depth of engagement with the literature is reasonable, though there seems to be a reliance on a single source (Beigang).\n\nOverall assessment of the main argument:\nThe student makes a convincing case that equalized odds is preferable to predictive parity because the latter reinforces historical biases. This core argument is valid and well-supported. The secondary arguments about historical nuance and legal alignment are present but less thoroughly developed. The essay acknowledges limitations of equalized odds but doesn't fully develop solutions. \n\nThe essay succeeds in making its central claim but could do more to address the \"so what?\" question - what practical steps should companies take beyond just choosing equalized odds as their metric? The student begins to address this in the sections on limitations and reframing but doesn't fully develop these points."

         "## Analyzing the essay based on the rubric criteria\n\n### 1. Thesis\nLet me look for the thesis statement in the essay:\n\nFrom the introduction: \"Data science objects are proposed as a tool for objective unbiased decision making, but often just replicate past biases. These products of data science well understood and because of that the intent of their use is misaligned with the outcomes they are putting into society. Instead of helping us move forward into an unbiased society, they are taking us back to past biases, bounding us to the same rationales that dominated past thinking and shaped inequalities.\"\n\nLater in the paper: \"Just as physical infrastructure can anchor racial inequalities, like with the city planning designed to segregate communities, algorithms function as digital material anchors---entrenching past biases in modern decision-making.\"\n\nThe essay seems to argue that data science products serve as material anchors for racism by perpetuating historical biases embedded in the data they use, thus maintaining systemic racism. While this thesis is present, it could be more explicitly and clearly stated in the introduction. The thesis does answer the question posed (can data science products be \"material anchors\" that support racism?) with an affirmative position.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good** - The thesis is present but could be more explicitly stated. It does take a clear position on the question.\n\n### 2. Argument Validity\n\nThe main premises of the argument appear to be:\n1. \"Data science products rely on historical data, but that data is often biased, reflecting past social inequalities, discrimination, and systemic racism.\"\n2. \"When a ML model then takes these biased datasets and makes a prediction, it is not a reflection of current society but perpetuating past inequalities.\"\n3. \"Material Anchors refers to how physical objects, infrastructure, and in this case, algorithms sustain and reinforce inequalities.\"\n4. \"In data science material anchors are those historical datasets that I have mentioned, built on discrimination, seclusion, and inequality, yet still shaping our society today years later.\"\n\nThe conclusion follows from these premises: data science products perpetuate historical biases, and by definition, this makes them material anchors for racism.\n\nThe premises are mostly explicit, but there are some gaps. The essay could more clearly articulate the normative premise about why perpetuating historical biases is morally problematic. The connection between material anchors and racism could be more rigorously established. There are no obvious logical fallacies, though some claims (like those in the personal stance section) are asserted without substantial support.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good** - Most premises are explicit; some connections could be more thoroughly established.\n\n### 3. Understanding\n\nThe essay introduces and explains key concepts:\n\"Data science products are tools such as algorithms that are built on historical data to support decision making.\"\n\"Material Anchors refers to how physical objects, infrastructure, and in this case, algorithms sustain and reinforce inequalities.\"\n\nThe explanation of material anchors appears accurate, though it could benefit from more explicit reference to scholarly sources on this concept. The student uses their own words to explain concepts and doesn't rely heavily on quotes.\n\nThe essay mentions \"systemic racism\" and attempts to define it: \"Systemic racism relates to structural or social racism, it is not at the individual scale nor is it cognitive. Structural racism is sustained in institutions and decisions over time, like anchoring bias, reinforcing the discrimination.\"\n\nWhile the explanations seem generally accurate, the essay could benefit from more explicit references to scholarly work on these concepts to demonstrate deeper understanding.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good** - Generally accurate summaries in student's own words, but lacks explicit references to academic sources.\n\n### 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nStructure:\nThe essay has a clear structure with an introduction, sections defining data science products and material anchors, a section connecting these concepts to racism, and a personal stance.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe essay appropriately breaks down the problem into parts:\n1. Defining data science products\n2. Explaining material anchors\n3. Connecting data science products to material anchors and racism\n\nThe essay provides examples to illustrate the concepts:\n- Credit scoring models, hiring algorithms, predictive policing\n- The New York City planning example (bridges designed to prevent certain populations from accessing areas)\n- Healthcare algorithms that predict patient risk\n\nHowever, the analysis of some concepts could be more thorough. The connection between data science products and material anchors could be analyzed in greater depth. The personal stance section makes strong claims without sufficient supporting evidence.\n\nClarity:\nThe writing is generally clear but has some grammatical issues and awkward phrasing. For example: \"These products of data science well understood and because of that the intent of their use is misaligned with the outcomes they are putting into society.\"\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good** - Reasonable breakdown of the problem; balanced analysis with appropriate examples; structure is clear but some areas could be analyzed more thoroughly.\n\n## Main Argument and Supporting Points\n\nMain Argument: Data science products function as material anchors for racism by perpetuating historical biases embedded in their training data, thereby reinforcing systemic racism and inequality in modern decision-making.\n\nSupporting Points:\n1. Data science products rely on historical data that contains biases reflecting past social inequalities and discrimination.\n2. These biases become embedded in algorithms through proxy variables (like zip codes) that correlate with protected characteristics like race.\n3. Physical infrastructure (like bridges in NYC) has historically functioned as material anchors for segregation; algorithms similarly anchor racial inequalities in digital form.\n4. Examples in healthcare, lending, and criminal justice show how algorithmic decisions reproduce historical patterns of discrimination.\n5. The perpetuation of these biases contributes to systemic racism by maintaining institutional barriers for marginalized communities.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\n1. The essay's argument about biased historical data is valid and well-supported with examples. However, it could better acknowledge the complexity of addressing these biases in practice.\n\n2. The connection between material anchors and algorithms is logically consistent but could be more rigorously established through scholarly references.\n\n3. The essay makes a logical leap in the personal stance section when claiming \"There is no using better data to train it on, because that world doesn't exist\" - this is an assertion that requires more support, as there are academic and industry efforts to create more representative datasets.\n\n4. The conclusion that \"tearing down institutions\" is necessary seems insufficiently supported by the preceding arguments.\n\n5. The essay accurately identifies the problematic relationship between historical data and perpetuating inequality but doesn't fully explore potential solutions or counterarguments.\n\n## Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear and logical structure that progresses from definitions to application to personal stance.\n\nLanguage: The language is generally clear but contains some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that occasionally impede understanding.\n\nExamples: The essay effectively uses concrete examples to illustrate concepts, which strengthens the arguments significantly.\n\nFocus: The essay stays focused on the question of whether data science products can be material anchors for racism. However, the personal stance section shifts somewhat from analysis to prescription without sufficient supporting evidence.\n\n## How Well the Essay Addresses the Assigned Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the assigned question \"Can data science products be 'material anchors' that support racism?\" and takes a clear affirmative position. It explains what data science products and material anchors are, then connects these concepts to show how data science products can function as material anchors for racism.\n\nThe essay provides examples to support this position and goes beyond merely restating the question to offer analysis and personal perspective. However, the essay could benefit from engaging more explicitly with scholarly literature on these topics and considering potential counterarguments.\n\nOverall, the essay provides a reasonable analysis of the question, though it could be strengthened with more rigorous argumentation and scholarly engagement."

         "## 1. Thesis\nThe essay presents a thesis that answers the question, but it could be more clearly and concisely stated. The thesis appears in the introduction: \"Within this essay we will explore how data science products were once utilitarian models; they serve as material anchors in the postmodern landscape that perpetuate systems of oppression through the creation, maintenance, and augmentation of power.\" The position is reiterated in the conclusion: \"While Data Science Products can be seen as material anchors that support racism and other systems of oppression that engage with socially embedded postmodern frameworks within our landscape, we must begin to push back on the majoritarian narratives that perpetuate systemic inequality within our country.\" While the student does take a position (yes, data science products can be material anchors that support racism), the thesis is somewhat buried in lengthy sentences and could be more decisively stated.",
         "## 2. Argument Validity\nThe essay attempts to construct an argument with some stated premises, but has several logical gaps. The premises include:\n1. Postmodern theory views technology as maintaining power structures\n2. Data science models rely on historically biased data\n3. Case studies (St. George's and COMPAS) show these models perpetuate racial biases\n\nHowever, several key premises are implicit rather than explicit, particularly normative premises about why maintaining power structures is problematic. The conclusion follows somewhat from the premises, but the connection isn't fully developed. For example, when the student states, \"The maintenance of unequal structures means the maintenance of power for a majority group, and dismantling this system means dismantling the status quo, which the powerful who are lucky to grasp onto it will never do,\" they make a significant claim without sufficient logical support.",
         "## 3. Understanding\nThe student demonstrates basic understanding of the concepts discussed but lacks depth in key areas. The essay references Lyotard's postmodernism: \"In the discourse of today's financial backers of research, the only credible goal is power. Scientists, technicians, and instruments are purchased not to find truth, but to augment power.\" However, the engagement with philosophical literature is limited to this single quote, and the student doesn't thoroughly explore the implications of postmodern theory for data science. The essay accurately describes the case studies but doesn't fully connect them to the philosophical framework. The explanation of what constitutes a \"material anchor\" is brief and underdeveloped: \"within this essay I will be using material anchors to refer to a device used to stabilize a structure.\"",

The essay states: \"Through the case studies we have clearly illustrated that AI models can perpetuate systemic harms against racial minorities and other marginalized peoples,\" but doesn't fully break down how this connects to the concept of \"material anchors.\" The essay also contains numerous mechanical errors (repeated words, typos like \"difffferent,\" \"LyLyotard\") that occasionally interfere with clarity.",

Your selection of case studies (St. George's Hospital and COMPAS) provides concrete examples that help illustrate your argument, which is a strength of your essay.\n\nFor your next essay, I'd recommend focusing on two key areas for improvement:\n\nFirst, work on clearly articulating your thesis and making your argument structure more explicit. While you do take a position, your key points and their logical connections could be more clearly presented. Try to state your main argument concisely and then explicitly show how your premises lead to your conclusion.\n\nSecond, deepen your engagement with philosophical literature. Your brief reference to Lyotard is a starting point, but your analysis would be stronger with more substantial discussion of postmodern theory and how it specifically relates to the concept of \"material anchors.\" This would give your essay the philosophical depth it needs.\n\nI can see you're thinking critically about important issues in data ethics, which is excellent.

         "Let me analyze this essay according to the rubric:\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nKey sentences:\n- \"Within this essay we will explore how data science products were once utilitarian models; they serve as material anchors in the postmodern landscape that perpetuate systems of oppression through the creation, maintenance, and augmentation of power.\"\n- \"As AI continues to grow in prominence, so will the inequities that come out of it. Continued innovation in the field of Data Science continues to serve as a mechanism for gaining and maintaining power.\"\n- \"While Data Science Products can be seen as material anchors that support racism and other systems of oppression that engage with socially embedded postmodern frameworks within our landscape, we must begin to push back on the majoritarian narratives that perpetuate systemic inequality within our country.\"\n\nThe essay does have a thesis that answers the question. The student argues that yes, data science products can be material anchors that support racism. They frame this within postmodern theory, arguing that these technologies serve to maintain power structures and systems of oppression. The thesis could be more clearly and concisely stated, but it is present and does take a decisive position.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good (the thesis is present but could be more explicitly stated)\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nKey sentences related to premises:\n- \"Postmodernism is known for its critique of universal truths, and explanation of how power is maintained, and augmented through innovation and development.\"\n- \"Jean-Francios Lyotard, who is regarded as the first philosopher to use the term 'Postmodernism' said in his book The Postmodern Condition 'In the discourse of today's financial backers of research, the only credible goal is power. Scientists, technicians, and instruments are purchased not to find truth, but to augment power.'\"\n- \"Through the case studies we have clearly illustrated that AI models can perpetuate systemic harms against racial minorities and other marginalized peoples.\"\n- \"Many of the issues we see within racial injustices in data science stem from decades of racially skewed data from over policing, to disproportionate rates of arrest, and decades of racial profiling.\"\n\nThe essay attempts to construct an argument that data science products support racism by:\n1. Establishing a theoretical framework (postmodernism) that views technology as a tool for maintaining power structures\n2. Providing case studies (St. George's Hospital Medical School's AI screening and COMPAS) to show how data science products can perpetuate racism\n3. Explaining how biased historical data leads to biased models\n4. Arguing that those in power have no incentive to fix these issues\n\nThere are some premises stated, but the logical connections between them aren't always explicit. The student relies on the case studies to make their point, but doesn't fully connect all the dots between the theoretical framework and the empirical evidence. The normative premise that maintaining power structures is problematic is implied rather than explicitly stated.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Needs Improvement (several premises missing or implicit; somewhat unclear connection between premises and conclusion)\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nKey sentences:\n- \"Jean-Francios Lyotard, who is regarded as the first philosopher to use the term 'Postmodernism' said in his book The Postmodern Condition 'In the discourse of today's financial backers of research, the only credible goal is power. Scientists, technicians, and instruments are purchased not to find truth, but to augment power.'\"\n- \"According to Northpointe, the developer of COMPAS, COMPAS takes a holistic and social theory-based approach, looking at psychological and cognitive markers. The model is backed by theories such as the Social Strain theory and the Control/Restraint theory which both try to explain the relationship between societal inequities and risk of recidivism.\"\n- \"ProPublica found that this specific program misclassified black defendants as high risk for recidivism twice as much as their white counterparts, and were 77% more likely to be assigned higher risk scores.\"\n\nThe student demonstrates some understanding of postmodern theory and the real-world cases they use as examples. They correctly attribute ideas to Lyotard and summarize the relevant aspects of the COMPAS system and the criticisms against it. However, the discussion of postmodernism is somewhat superficial and the student doesn't engage deeply with the philosophical literature. The essay relies on one quote from Lyotard without fully exploring the implications of postmodern theory for data science.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Needs Improvement (some understanding but superficial treatment of key concepts; limited engagement with philosophical literature)\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nKey sentences:\n- \"As we set up our argument we need to understand a few things; what do I mean by material anchors, what is postmodernism within my analysis, and how can we understand not just racism but other systems of oppression.\"\n- \"To further apply these ideas we are going to look at two case studies.\"\n- \"Through the case studies we have clearly illustrated that AI models can perpetuate systemic harms against racial minorities and other marginalized peoples. However addressing these inequities becomes harder than simply reformulating a model.\"\n\nThe essay has a basic structure:\n1. Introduction and thesis\n2. Definition of key terms (material anchors, postmodernism)\n3. Case studies (St. George's Hospital Medical School, COMPAS)\n4. Analysis of why these problems persist\n5. Conclusion restating the thesis\n\nThe student attempts to break down the problem into parts and provides examples to illustrate their points. However, the analysis is sometimes imbalanced - they spend more time describing the COMPAS case than analyzing its philosophical implications. Some parts of the essay (like the discussion of postmodernism) are too brief and underdeveloped. The essay also has several mechanical errors (repeated words, typos) that occasionally affect clarity.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Needs Improvement (imbalanced analysis; some parts underdeveloped)\n\n## Main Argument\nThe main argument of the essay is that data science products serve as material anchors that support racism by perpetuating existing power structures and systems of oppression. The student argues that these technologies, rather than being neutral tools, reflect and reinforce societal biases, particularly racial biases.\n\n## Supporting Points\n1. Data science models rely on historical data that already contains biases (e.g., overpolicing of minority communities).\n2. Case studies (St. George's Hospital Medical School, COMPAS) demonstrate how these models reproduce and amplify racial biases.\n3. Those in power have no incentive to correct these biases as they benefit from maintaining the status quo.\n4. Through the postmodern lens, technological developments like data science serve to augment power rather than discover truth.\n5. The biases in these models disproportionately affect marginalized communities, particularly racial minorities.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\nThe student's arguments have several strengths and weaknesses:\n\nStrengths:\n- The case studies provide concrete examples of how data science products can perpetuate racism.\n- The discussion of how biased historical data leads to biased models is accurate.\n- The postmodern framework is relevant to the question, though underdeveloped.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The student doesn't fully explain what they mean by \"material anchors\" and how exactly data science products fulfill this role.\n- The connection between postmodernism and data science isn't fully developed.\n- The essay sometimes makes claims without sufficient evidence (e.g., \"The maintenance of unequal structures means the maintenance of power for a majority group, and dismantling this system means dismantling the status quo, which the powerful who are lucky to grasp onto it will never do.\").\n- Some arguments are too general and lack nuance (e.g., the claim that the powerful \"will never\" give up their power).\n- The essay occasionally strays from its focus on racism to discuss other forms of discrimination without fully connecting these to the central thesis.\n\n## Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure:\nThe essay has a basic structure but could be more organized. The introduction, while attempting to set up the argument, is somewhat confusing. The conclusion restates the thesis but doesn't offer much synthesis of the arguments presented.\n\nLanguage:\nThe essay has numerous mechanical errors, including repeated words (\"y, w,\"), awkward phrasing, and typos (\"difffferent,\" \"LyLyotard\"). These occasionally interfere with clarity.\n\nExamples:\nThe examples (St. George's Hospital Medical School and COMPAS) are relevant and help illustrate the thesis. However, the student spends too much time describing the COMPAS system and not enough time analyzing its philosophical implications.\n\nFocus:\nThe essay sometimes loses focus by discussing issues beyond racism (like neurodiversity and socioeconomic status) without clearly tying these back to the main argument about racism.\n\n## Addressing the Assigned Question\n\nThe assigned question asks \"Can Data Science products be material anchors that support Racism?\" The essay does directly address this question and takes a clear position (yes). However, the student doesn't fully explain what they mean by \"material anchors\" beyond a brief definition, and they don't thoroughly analyze the philosophical implications of this concept.\n\nOverall, the essay has some strengths - it takes a clear position, provides relevant examples, and attempts to engage with philosophical concepts. However, it has significant weaknesses in terms of logical structure, depth of philosophical engagement, and mechanical errors."

         "Let me begin by analyzing this essay according to the rubric criteria:\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nThe essay addresses the question \"Are data-driven tools for recidivism risk assessment objective?\" Let me identify the thesis statement:\n\n> \"I argue that while advocates for recidivism risk assessment tools claim them to be objective and neutral predictors, in reality, these tools often encode human bias and perpetuate or even amplify inequalities; these models do not reflect objective reality, but instead reflect historic inequities and flawed data.\"\n\nThis appears in the last paragraph of the introduction. The thesis clearly takes a position that these tools are not objective, answering the question directly. The student provides specific reasoning - that the tools encode bias, perpetuate inequalities, and reflect historic inequities rather than objective reality.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Excellent** - The thesis is clearly stated and decisively answers the question.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nKey premises of the argument include:\n\n1. \"Data is flawed or incomplete in some way in nearly every application, guaranteeing some level of error.\"\n2. \"Though these models only offer recommendations and do not make the final decisions for a judge, the ability for models to bias a judgment should not be understated.\"\n3. \"There is an imbalance in policing of rich versus poorer neighborhoods and a statistical inequality in the individuals police choose to stop for questioning.\"\n4. \"As long as criminal justice data remains incomplete, recidivism risk assessment tools will never be objective.\"\n5. \"Statistical models themselves hold no bias or judgment, but they swiftly learn through interactions with human biases.\"\n\nThe conclusion follows logically from these premises: if the data used to train these models contains biases from unequal policing and other social inequities, and if algorithms learn from this biased data, then the resulting risk assessment tools will encode and potentially amplify these biases rather than providing objective assessments.\n\nThe student does explicitly acknowledge a counterargument: \"Advocates for recidivism risk models suggest that they are not inherently biased, and I generally agree with this statement.\" The student then refutes this by explaining how even well-designed algorithms interact with flawed data to produce flawed results.\n\nThe connection between premises and conclusion is clear, and I don't detect any major logical fallacies. The student has made their normative premise explicit - that these tools should not be used until they can be made more objective.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good to Excellent** - Most premises are explicit with a clear connection to the conclusion. The key normative premise is present. The argument could perhaps use more explicit connection between some of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nThe essay references two main texts:\n1. Ludwig and Mullainathan's \"Fragile Algorithms and Fallible Decision Makers\"\n2. Cathy O'Neil's \"Weapons of Math Destruction\"\n\nLet me examine how the student summarizes and uses these texts:\n\nFor Ludwig and Mullainathan:\n> \"Ludwig and Mullainathan, in their article Fragile Algorithms and Fallible Decision Makers, show that these algorithms, while achieving their goal of consistency, did not achieve the desired accuracy rates. Some algorithms made errors at a similar rate as judges, and others actively perpetuated discrimination.\"\n\n> \"As Ludwig and Mullainathan emphasize, an algorithm's recommendation can only be as accurate as the data it is trained on.\"\n\n> \"Fragile Algorithms and Fallible Decision Makers explains that well-built algorithms have immense potential to reduce injustice and eliminate human error; the issue lies with the fact that many risk models are poorly designed.\"\n\nFor O'Neil:\n> \"Cathy O'Neil details the ways in which algorithms tend to positively cater to already-privileged individuals while exacerbating discrimination and prejudice among minorities and disadvantaged groups in her text, Weapons of Math Destruction.\"\n\n> \"O'Neil highlights a 2013 study that found that though Black and Latino males aged 14-24 made up less than 5% of the New York City population, they accounted for over 40% of stop-and-frisk searches by police.\"\n\n> \"O'Neil highlights that some states only use these predictive scores to evaluate which inmates should be prioritized for anti-recidivism projects, and the models do not impact sentencing or parole.\"\n\nThe student summarizes these texts in their own words rather than relying on direct quotes. The summaries appear accurate and relevant to the argument being made. The student uses the texts to support different aspects of their argument - Ludwig and Mullainathan for discussing the technical limitations of algorithms, and O'Neil for discussing the social impacts and inequities these algorithms can perpetuate.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good to Excellent** - The texts are accurately summarized in the student's own words, and the student shows a good understanding of the material.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nThe essay is structured with an introduction, two main sections (titled \"Designed Discrimination\" and \"Conclusion\"), and a conclusion. The main body of the essay:\n\n1. Introduces the problem of predicting recidivism\n2. Discusses the technical challenges and limitations of risk assessment tools\n3. Examines how these tools can encode and perpetuate biases\n4. Acknowledges counterarguments about algorithm neutrality\n5. Concludes with recommendations for the future\n\nThe essay breaks down the problem into appropriate parts - the technical limitations of algorithms, the biases in the data used to train them, and the social impacts of using these tools. The analysis is focused and the level of detail is generally appropriate for a 1500-word essay.\n\nThe essay is generally clear, though there are some formatting issues (duplicated letters in words like \"fofor\" and \"objbjective\") that might be scanning/OCR errors rather than the student's writing. The student uses examples effectively, such as discussing specific questions on the LSI-R questionnaire and how they might disadvantage certain individuals.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good** - The problem is broken down into suitable parts with a reasonable level of detail. The analysis could perhaps be more balanced between technical and social aspects.\n\n## Main Argument and Supporting Points\n\nMain Argument: Data-driven tools for recidivism risk assessment are not objective because they encode human biases from the data they're trained on and perpetuate or amplify existing inequalities in the criminal justice system.\n\nSupporting Points:\n1. Algorithms can only be as accurate as the data they're trained on, and criminal justice data is often flawed or incomplete.\n2. Risk assessment tools like LSI-R ask questions about an individual's background that can disadvantage those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds or minority communities.\n3. Inequalities in policing create a feedback loop where certain communities are over-policed, leading to more arrests, which then influences the data used in these algorithms.\n4. Even well-designed algorithms learn from biased data, encoding and potentially amplifying existing biases.\n5. These tools have real impacts on people's lives, potentially changing the course of an individual's life based on flawed predictions.\n\nThe student's argument is valid and logical. They acknowledge that the algorithms themselves may not be inherently biased, but argue that their interaction with biased data produces biased outcomes. This is a nuanced position that demonstrates critical thinking.\n\nThe essay addresses the assigned question directly and thoroughly. The student considers both technical and social aspects of the problem, though the social aspects receive more attention. The essay could potentially benefit from a more in-depth discussion of what objectivity means in this context and more explicit connection between the points about data bias and the conclusion about lack of objectivity.\n\nOverall, the essay demonstrates good critical thinking, understanding of the material, and focused analysis of the problem. The main weaknesses are some imbalance in the analysis (focus on social aspects over technical ones) and some formatting issues that affect readability.\n\nNow let's assess this essay holistically:\n\n1. Thesis: **Excellent** - Clear, decisive thesis that directly answers the question\n2. Argument Validity: **Good to Excellent** - Mostly explicit premises with clear connection to conclusion\n3. Understanding: **Good to Excellent** - Accurate summaries of texts in student's own words\n4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity: **Good** - Reasonable breakdown of problem with focused analysis, though some parts could be more balanced\n\nBased on this analysis, the essay demonstrates strong performance across all criteria, with some room for improvement in the balance and depth of analysis in certain areas."

         "Thesis\nThe essay presents a clear and decisive thesis that directly answers the question. In the introduction, the student states: \"This final recommendation will be to apply the definition of separation, which requires equal false and true positive rates across groups. This definition allows for a balance to be attained where a company can focus on diverse hiring practices, while still ensuring that each new employee hired will have the optimal probability to continue on successfully in the company.\" This thesis is reinforced in the conclusion where the student reiterates their recommendation for the separation definition of fairness. The thesis is strong, specific, and takes a clear position on the question.",
         "Argument Validity\nThe essay presents a structured argument with explicitly stated premises for each fairness definition. The student systematically evaluates independence (\"ensuring equal hiring rates across different protected groups\"), sufficiency (\"equalized risk rates\"), and separation (\"equal rates between the false positive rate and the false negative rate\"). For each definition, the student provides clear reasoning for why it would or wouldn't work well for the company's goals. The normative premise about balancing diversity with hiring qualified candidates is clearly articulated: \"It will be important to balance the idea that separate groups should have equalized odds in the system, so as to avoid claims of discrimination, with the concept of predictive parity, as we want our system to accurately predict the potential employee's success.\" The conclusion follows logically from the premises established throughout the essay.",
         "Understanding\nThe student demonstrates good understanding of the three definitions of fairness from Barocas' \"Fairness and Machine Learning.\" Each definition is accurately summarized in the student's own words with explanations of how they would function in practice. The student also shows understanding of related concepts like \"redundant encodings\" and \"base rates.\" For example: \"This is the idea that even if we remove one's sensitive characteristic from the data set, there are still other characteristics that are common among that specific protected group.\" The explanations are generally accurate, though there could be more precision in some areas. The essay doesn't rely on direct quotations and instead reformulates the concepts appropriately.",
         "Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\nThe essay has a logical structure with an introduction, separate analysis of each fairness definition, and a conclusion. The problem is broken down into appropriate parts, with each fairness definition examined in terms of its advantages and disadvantages for the specific resume screening scenario. The student provides an appropriate level of detail for each definition and maintains focus throughout. For instance, when explaining separation: \"For this case, the false positive rate would be the rate of applicants who are wrongfully called in for an interview, while the false negative is the rate of applicants who are wrongfully not called in for an interview.\" The analysis is balanced across the different definitions before arriving at a recommendation.",

Your explanation of concepts like redundant encodings and base rates shows good comprehension of the material.\n\nFor future essays, consider two areas for improvement: First, while you argue that separation strikes a \"perfect balance,\" it would strengthen your analysis to acknowledge more explicitly what tradeoffs might still exist with this approach. No fairness definition is without some compromise. Second, including more concrete examples or hypothetical scenarios would help illustrate your points more vividly.\n\nAlso, be sure to proofread carefully - there are some typographical errors with repeated letters in words like \"sufficiency\" and \"differences\" that should be fixed.\n\nOverall, this is excellent work that shows careful thought and strong analytical skills!",

         "Let me analyze this student essay based on the provided rubric and guidelines.\n\n## Thesis\n\nLooking for the thesis in the essay:\n\n> \"This final recommendation will be to apply the definition of separation, which requires equal false and true positive rates across groups. This definition allows for a balance to be attained where a company can focus on diverse hiring practices, while still ensuring that each new employee hired will have the optimal probability to continue on successfully in the company.\"\n\nThis appears at the end of the introduction paragraph. It is a clear statement of the author's position on what definition of fairness should be used.\n\nAnother statement reinforcing the thesis:\n\n> \"As a result, I recommended that the separation definition be used when creating this machine learning system. This definition allowed for a balance between diverse hiring practices, and recruiting the most effective, successful team possible.\"\n\nThe thesis is clearly stated, answers the question directly, and presents a decisive position. The student takes a clear stance by recommending the \"separation\" definition of fairness specifically. This would fall under \"Excellent\" on the rubric for the thesis criterion.\n\n## Argument Validity\n\nThe key premises of the argument appear to be:\n\n1. There are three definitions of fairness to consider: independence, sufficiency, and separation.\n2. Independence enforces equal hiring rates across protected groups but can lead to poor predictions if base rates differ.\n3. Sufficiency gives individuals scores that represent the same likelihood of success regardless of group membership but does not address historical biases.\n4. Separation equalizes false positive and false negative rates across groups, balancing diversity with performance prediction.\n5. A fair hiring system should both ensure diverse perspectives and optimize for qualified candidates.\n\nKey quotes regarding premises:\n\n> \"It will be important to balance the idea that separate groups should have equalized odds in the system, so as to avoid claims of discrimination, with the concept of predictive parity, as we want our system to accurately predict the potential employee's success.\"\n\n> \"In action, this definition [separation] seeks to ensure that there will be equal rates between the false positive rate (FPR) and the false negative rate (FNR).\"\n\n> \"Where independence can have too strong of a hand in undoing historical bias, and sufficiency has the legitimate possibility of perpetuating it, this definition strikes a perfect balance.\"\n\nThe conclusion (that separation is the best definition of fairness for the company) follows logically from the premises. The student systematically evaluates each definition against the dual goals of diversity and predictive accuracy, showing how separation balances these concerns.\n\nThe premises are explicitly stated throughout the essay, and there is a clear connection between them and the conclusion. The normative premise about balancing diversity and prediction accuracy is present. The argument appears valid without obvious fallacies.\n\nThis would fall under \"Excellent\" or high \"Good\" on the rubric for argument validity.\n\n## Understanding\n\nThe student demonstrates understanding of the three definitions of fairness from Barocas' \"Fairness and Machine Learning\":\n\n> \"These distinct definitions of fairness have been termed 1) independence, 2) separation, and 3) sufficiency.\"\n\nThe student explains each definition in their own words:\n\nIndependence: \"This definition of fairness is given as ensuring equal hiring rates across different protected groups, done by making the protected characteristic 'independent' of the data used by the machine to generate a prediction.\"\n\nSufficiency: \"This definition of fairness has to do with equalized risk rates, seeking to create a machine-learning system that gives each potential employee a score. The key with this scoring is that for different groups, a specific score denotes the same possibility of success or failure for an individual, regardless of the protected group...\"\n\nSeparation: \"In action, this definition seeks to ensure that there will be equal rates between the false positive rate (FPR) and the false negative rate (FNR).\"\n\nThe student also demonstrates understanding of related concepts like \"redundant encodings\" and \"base rates.\"\n\nThere are no apparent misinterpretations of the referenced texts, though there are some minor issues in expressing these concepts precisely. The student presents these ideas in their own words without excessive direct quotation.\n\nThis would fall under high \"Good\" or possibly \"Excellent\" on the rubric for understanding.\n\n## Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nStructure:\nThe essay follows a clear structure with an introduction, separate sections for each fairness definition, and a conclusion. The introduction presents the problem and thesis, and each body paragraph focuses on one definition of fairness.\n\nDetail:\nFor each definition, the student provides:\n- An explanation of the definition\n- Advantages of the definition\n- Disadvantages of the definition\n- An assessment of its suitability for the company's needs\n\nExample of breakdown of problem:\n> \"First, I will discuss independence, which in my opinion is the most 'brute force' option, sometimes viewed as a quota.\"\n> \"Next, I will evaluate the definition of fairness termed sufficiency.\"\n> \"Finally, I will speak on the definition of fairness known as separation.\"\n\nThe analysis is focused and thorough, breaking down the problem into suitable parts. The student dedicates similar attention to each definition before settling on their recommendation.\n\nLevel of Detail:\nThe student provides appropriate detail for each definition, explaining not just what it is but how it would work in practice for the company's resume screening system.\n\n> \"For this case, the false positive rate would be the rate of applicants who are wrongfully called in for an interview, while the false negative is the rate of applicants who are wrongfully not called in for an interview, so the key to a good hiring model is a low FNR which is equalized across protected groups.\"\n\nThis would fall under \"Excellent\" or high \"Good\" on the rubric for analysis, structure, and clarity.\n\n## Main Argument\n\nThe main argument of the essay is that a company implementing ML for resume screening should use the \"separation\" definition of fairness (equalizing false positive and false negative rates across protected groups) because it best balances the competing goals of maintaining diversity in hiring while optimizing for qualified candidates.\n\n## Supporting Points\n1. Independence (demographic parity) would force equal hiring rates across groups even when base rates differ, potentially leading to less qualified candidates being hired.\n2. Sufficiency (equalizing risk scores) would ensure fair individual assessment but might perpetuate historical biases and lead to a less diverse workforce.\n3. Separation (equalizing error rates) strikes a balance by both addressing historical bias and ensuring qualified candidates are selected.\n4. Separation prevents disparate impact by ensuring no group is disproportionately rejected or accepted.\n5. The tradeoff for separation is that it requires more careful data tracking, but this cost is worth the benefit.\n\n## Critical Examination\n- The student correctly identifies that base rates may differ across protected groups and that this affects which fairness definition is appropriate.\n- The analysis of independence is solid, recognizing both its strength in promoting diversity and its weakness in potentially sacrificing qualification.\n- The discussion of sufficiency correctly notes its focus on individual risk assessment but also its limitation in addressing historical bias.\n- The analysis of separation is generally sound, though the student may slightly overstate its ability to \"balance\" competing concerns without acknowledging potential tradeoffs.\n- The conclusion logically follows from the analysis presented.\n\n## Assessment of Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n- Structure: The essay has a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs examining each definition, and a conclusion.\n- Language: The language is generally clear but has some awkward phrasing and typographical errors (e.g., \"sufffficiency,\" \"difffferences\").\n- Examples: The student provides examples of how each definition would work in practice for resume screening, though more concrete examples would strengthen the essay.\n- Focus: The essay maintains focus on the question of which fairness definition the company should adopt, without drifting into unrelated topics.\n\n## Addressing the Question\nThe essay directly addresses the question of what definition of fairness the company should take for its ML resume screening system. It examines the three main definitions of fairness, evaluates them against the company's needs, and provides a clear recommendation.\n\n## Overall Assessment of the Essay\nThis is a strong essay that demonstrates a good understanding of fairness definitions in ML and applies them thoughtfully to the resume screening scenario. The student presents a clear thesis, evaluates multiple definitions systematically, and provides a well-reasoned recommendation.\n\nAreas for improvement include:\n- Fixing typographical errors (extra f's in words)\n- Providing more concrete examples or hypothetical scenarios\n- More explicitly acknowledging the inevitable tradeoffs involved in any definition of fairness\n\nThe student has satisfied the word limit requirement while providing sufficient depth of analysis."

         "Let me begin by carefully analyzing the student essay according to the provided rubric. I'll assess each criterion, identify the main argument, supporting points, and evaluate the essay's structure and content.\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nLet me first identify the thesis statement in the essay:\n\nThe conclusion paragraph states: \"But these products, these material anchors, are nothing more than tools that have emotions, feelings, and labels thrusted onto them when they don't work accurately. The feelings that can be caused due to their shortcomings are valid, but the chance that it is targeted is low. These limited thought, \"dumb\" data science products often fall under misuse or insufficient data but to say these material anchors support racism is far from fact.\"\n\nAlso, in the introduction: \"For this essay, overall use of motion sensors and cameras and how the limited \"thinking\" they are allowed, while making some people uncomfortable, is a constraint of technology and projection of larger issues rather than an act of mechanized racism.\"\n\nThe thesis appears to be that so-called \"dumb\" automated machines and non-generative AI tools are not racist in themselves but rather have technological limitations that might be misinterpreted as racism. The author argues that these limitations are not racist intent but technological constraints.\n\nThis thesis does answer the question of whether data science products can be \"material anchors\" that support racism, but with a negative response. The thesis is somewhat clearly stated, though it could be more explicitly formulated. It takes a clear position that these products do not support racism.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good**. The thesis is present and takes a position, but it could be more explicitly stated and better developed throughout the essay.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nThe main argument seems to be:\n1. \"Dumb\" automated machines have limited data and functionality\n2. These limitations can cause these machines to fail with certain users (e.g., darker skin)\n3. However, these failures are due to technological constraints, not racist intent\n4. People may project racial bias onto these failures due to past experiences with racism\n5. Therefore, these machines are not \"material anchors\" that support racism\n\nKey sentences:\n\"People who have experienced racism most likely recall it often, feeling invalidated, alienated, or even traumatized. These are all valid feelings and reactions for one to have, however, some people, both who have and have no dealt with racism in the past, could be projecting their issues or fears onto things that do not and cannot hold such views.\"\n\n\"If for any reason the sensor cannot reflect, then it cannot function. This can be due to one not positioning themselves correctly to cause the reflection (operator error) or because the sensor itself is not strong enough to be reflected and instead becomes absorbed by what is presented in front of it (in this case, the hand of a darker skinned black man).\"\n\nThe argument has some premises explicitly stated, but there are missing premises and normative assumptions. For example, the essay assumes that for something to \"support racism,\" it must have intentionality or be designed with racist intent. This assumption is not explicitly addressed or defended. The student doesn't fully engage with the possibility that systems can perpetuate racial inequalities without intentional design.\n\nThe essay fails to fully address the concept of \"material anchors\" from Liao and Huebner and doesn't thoroughly analyze how these technologies might reinforce racist norms even without intention.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Needs Improvement**. The premises are somewhat explicit but several premises are missing. The connection between premises and conclusion is somewhat unclear, and there are potential logical fallacies (such as assuming that racism requires intention).\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nThe essay references Liao and Huebner's work:\n\"As referenced by Liao and Huebner, a black man recorded, with a humorous perspective, a soap dispenser that did not dispense for him but did for his white friend. Also mentioned by them was another black person who found she affected by the camera and how brown skin came out on color film.\"\n\n\"Liao and Huebner think that any data science product that cause such feelings as mentioned above, ones that perpetuate behaviors, associations, or feelings with negativity due to psychological judgments, are rooting in racism and help reinforce racist norm in society.\"\n\nWhile the student does reference Liao and Huebner's work, the summary is brief and somewhat oversimplified. The essay doesn't fully engage with the concept of \"material anchors\" as presented by Liao and Huebner. There's no in-depth discussion of how these technologies might function as material anchors for racist norms or behaviors. The summary of their position is cursory.\n\nThe student's interpretation that Liao and Huebner believe \"if it feels racist, it probably is racist\" simplifies what is likely a more nuanced argument in the original text.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Needs Improvement**. There are some significant misunderstandings or oversimplifications of the referenced texts. The engagement with the concept of \"material anchors\" is superficial.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nThe essay is organized into sections with headings:\n- Introduction (untitled)\n- The Culprits\n- Caught in the Act?\n- Err on the Side of Error\n- Let's Recap\n\nThe structure provides some organization, but the analysis within each section is somewhat superficial. The essay focuses primarily on two examples (soap dispensers and cameras) but doesn't analyze them in sufficient depth.\n\nKey sentences:\n\"These limited thought, \"dumb\" data science products often fall under misuse or insufficient data but to say these material anchors support racism is far from fact.\"\n\n\"Of course, one can claim that the inabilities, or failures, of the data in the product to function as perfectly as they do with any lighter skinned person can itself be racist.\"\n\nThe essay attempts to break down the problem into parts (types of AI, examples of perceived racism, explanations for technological failures), but the analysis remains somewhat superficial. The student mentions but doesn't fully engage with counter-arguments, such as the possibility that technological limitations that disproportionately affect certain races could themselves be considered forms of structural racism.\n\nThe essay could benefit from a more focused analysis of what constitutes a \"material anchor\" and how technologies might reinforce racist norms even without intentional design.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Needs Improvement**. The breakdown of the problem has reasonable parts, but the analysis is imbalanced and somewhat superficial.\n\n## Main Argument\nThe main argument presented in the essay is that basic data science products like motion sensors and cameras have technological limitations that can cause them to function poorly for people with darker skin, but these limitations are not forms of racism. Instead, the author argues that people may be projecting their experiences of racism onto these technologies, when the issues are actually due to technological constraints or user error.\n\n## Supporting Points\n1. Basic data science products operate on limited data and cannot \"learn\" like more sophisticated AI.\n2. Motion sensors and cameras function based on simple principles (like light reflection) that may not work as well with darker skin.\n3. People's negative experiences with these technologies may be due to their past experiences with racism causing them to interpret technical failures as racist.\n4. The technologies don't have intentions or capabilities to discriminate; they simply have technical limitations.\n5. While the feelings of those affected are valid, attributing racism to these technologies misplaces the issue.\n\n## Critical Examination of Argument Validity\nThe main argument has several logical weaknesses:\n\n1. The essay assumes that for something to be racist or support racism, it must have intentionality or be designed with racist intent. This ignores the concept of structural racism or how systems can perpetuate inequalities without intentional design.\n\n2. The essay presents a false dichotomy: either the technology is intentionally racist or it's just a technical limitation. It doesn't adequately address the possibility that technical limitations that disproportionately affect certain races could themselves be forms of structural racism.\n\n3. The argument that people are \"projecting\" racism onto technologies shifts blame to the victims without acknowledging that technologies that consistently fail for certain racial groups create real inequalities regardless of intent.\n\n4. The essay doesn't adequately address Liao and Huebner's concept of \"material anchors\" and how technologies might reinforce racist norms or behaviors even without intentional design.\n\n5. The essay doesn't engage with the question of responsibility: if companies know their technologies don't work well for people with darker skin but release them anyway, is that a form of negligence that supports racist outcomes?\n\n## Assessment of Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n- Structure: The essay has a clear structure with headings, but the flow between sections could be improved. The introduction and conclusion are somewhat repetitive.\n- Language: The writing is generally clear but contains grammatical errors and awkward phrasing in places.\n- Examples: The essay uses two main examples (soap dispensers and cameras) mentioned by Liao and Huebner but doesn't analyze them in sufficient depth or provide additional examples.\n- Focus: The essay focuses on refuting the idea that basic data science products can be racist but doesn't fully engage with the concept of \"material anchors\" from the prompt.\n\n## Addressing the Assigned Question\nThe essay directly addresses the question of whether data science products can be \"material anchors\" that support racism, arguing that they cannot. However, it doesn't fully engage with the concept of \"material anchors\" as used by Liao and Huebner. The student narrows the scope to \"dumb\" automated machines and non-generative AI, which is reasonable, but then doesn't thoroughly analyze how even these limited technologies might function as material anchors for racist norms or behaviors.\n\nThe essay also neglects to consider how the design choices and testing procedures that lead to technologies that work better for light skin than dark skin might themselves reflect and reinforce racist norms in society.\n\nOverall, while the essay does address the question, it doesn't engage with it at the depth required for a philosophical analysis."

         "Let me analyze the student essay based on the provided rubric and guidelines:\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nRelevant quotes from the essay:\n- \"In this essay, I argue that the company should adopt a causal fairness definition when designing its résumé-screening algorithm.\"\n- \"Specifically, the company should aim to ensure that protected attributes like race, gender, and age do not directly cause disparities in candidates' chances of being selected.\"\n- \"This causal approach avoids the consequences of statistical fairness metrics and offers an ethically defensible, context-specific path to fairness that aligns with the company's goal of building a workforce where hiring decisions are driven by job-relevant qualifications, not by other characteristics.\"\n\nThe essay has a clearly stated thesis that directly answers the question. The student takes a decisive position by advocating for a specific approach to fairness (causal fairness) and provides justification for this choice. The thesis appears in the introduction and is later reiterated and expanded upon throughout the essay.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nRelevant quotes:\n- \"The issue with these definitions and approaches is they are unable to coexist. Beigang (2023) has argued that both definitions are mathematically incompatible when different groups have different base rates of success.\"\n- \"The causal approach to fairness can be defined as focusing on whether a protected characteristic (race, gender, etc.) has a causal effect on errors or predictive value, beyond its relevance to the task at hand.\"\n- \"Under the causal approach, fairness requires that decisions are not influenced by irrelevant characteristics like race or gender.\"\n\nThe essay presents a clear argument structure. The student identifies problems with alternative fairness definitions, establishes premises about why causal fairness is superior, and concludes that the causal approach is the most appropriate solution. The premises are generally well-connected to the conclusion, though some intermediate logical steps could be more explicitly developed.\n\nThe essay uses normative premises about what fairness should entail (decisions based on relevant qualifications rather than protected characteristics) and connects these to the recommended approach. However, the essay could more explicitly state some of the premises underlying its argument for why causal fairness is superior to other approaches.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nRelevant quotes:\n- \"Fairness in algorithmic decision-making refers to the just and equitable treatment of individuals or groups in the selection process. Many definitions of fairness exist, but two dominant statistical approaches have emerged: equalized odds and predictive parity.\"\n- \"Beigang (2023) has argued that both definitions are mathematically incompatible when different groups have different base rates of success.\"\n- \"The goal of matching is to create comparable pairs of individuals across groups who are similar in all relevant ways except for their group characteristics.\"\n\nThe essay demonstrates a good understanding of fairness concepts in machine learning. The student correctly identifies and describes different fairness definitions and explains their limitations. The student's understanding of causal fairness and matching techniques appears accurate. The essay shows familiarity with relevant literature (citing Beigang) and presents concepts in the student's own words rather than relying heavily on quotes.\n\nHowever, the depth of engagement with the literature seems somewhat limited. Only one source (Beigang) is explicitly referenced, which raises questions about the breadth of the student's research. Additionally, while the concepts are generally well-explained, some advanced aspects of causal fairness could be expanded upon.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nRelevant quotes:\n- \"In this essay, I argue that the company should adopt a causal fairness definition when designing its résumé-screening algorithm.\"\n- \"Consider the résumé screening system the company wants to use for this example. Suppose two candidates, one male and one female, have identical degrees, work experience, and skills.\"\n- \"One objection for causal fairness is that it requires identifying and controlling for all relevant qualifications, which is practically impossible.\"\n\nThe essay has a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs that develop the argument, consideration of objections, and a conclusion. The student breaks down the problem appropriately by first defining fairness concepts, then explaining causal fairness, defending this approach, providing a concrete example, addressing potential objections, and concluding.\n\nThe use of a specific example about male and female candidates helps illustrate the concept of causal fairness in a practical context. The student also shows critical thinking by acknowledging limitations and responding to potential objections.\n\nHowever, some sections could benefit from more in-depth analysis. For instance, the section defending the causal approach could provide more detailed ethical reasoning. Additionally, some parts of the essay (particularly the objections and responses) feel somewhat rushed compared to others.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good\n\n## Main Argument\n\nThe main argument of the essay is that a company using machine learning to screen résumés should adopt a causal fairness definition because it most effectively ensures that protected attributes do not unfairly influence hiring decisions while allowing legitimate qualifications to determine outcomes.\n\n## Supporting Points\n\n1. Statistical fairness definitions (equalized odds and predictive parity) are mathematically incompatible when different groups have different base rates of success, making them problematic frameworks for ensuring fairness.\n\n2. A causal approach to fairness focuses on whether protected characteristics directly cause disparities in selection, which better aligns with ethical principles that individuals should be assessed based on job-relevant qualifications.\n\n3. Matching techniques can help implement causal fairness by comparing candidates with similar qualifications who differ only in protected characteristics, revealing whether those characteristics unfairly influence decisions.\n\n4. The causal approach allows distinguishing between disparities caused by discrimination and those resulting from legitimate differences in qualifications, avoiding the over-correction that statistical fairness measures might impose.\n\n5. While implementing causal fairness perfectly is challenging, even approximate implementation offers meaningful improvements in fairness compared to statistical approaches.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\nThe student's argument for causal fairness is generally valid. The premises about the limitations of statistical fairness definitions and the advantages of causal approaches logically support the conclusion that causal fairness is preferable. However, there are some weaknesses:\n\n1. The essay asserts that under causal fairness, equalized odds and predictive parity \"would be mathematically equivalent and reconciles the trade-off between the two fairness definitions.\" This claim needs more explanation or evidence, as it seems to contradict the earlier assertion about mathematical incompatibility.\n\n2. The essay could more thoroughly examine whether causal fairness is practically implementable, beyond acknowledging that perfect matching is unlikely. More discussion of technical approaches to approximating causal fairness would strengthen the argument.\n\n3. The ethical foundations for preferring causal fairness could be more deeply explored. The essay briefly mentions that fairness means assessing individuals on job-relevant qualifications, but could develop this normative position more thoroughly.\n\n4. The response to objections about measuring relevant variables feels somewhat superficial. The suggestion to combine causal fairness with qualitative assessments doesn't fully address how this would work within an automated ML system.\n\n## Essay Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay follows a logical structure, starting with a thesis, explaining key concepts, making arguments, addressing objections, and concluding. The flow is generally good, though some transitions between sections could be smoother.\n\nLanguage: The language is clear and appropriate for an academic essay. Technical concepts are explained in accessible terms. The writing is generally precise, though some sentences could be more concise.\n\nExamples: The essay includes a helpful example of comparing male and female candidates with identical qualifications. This concrete illustration effectively demonstrates how causal fairness would work in practice. However, more examples could have been included to show how causal fairness applies in other scenarios.\n\nFocus: The essay maintains focus on the central question of what fairness definition the company should adopt. It doesn't stray into tangential issues and keeps its analysis centered on comparing different fairness approaches and advocating for causal fairness.\n\n## Addressing the Assigned Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the assigned question, which asks what definition of fairness a company should take when using ML to screen résumés. The student takes a clear position (advocating for causal fairness) and provides justification for this choice. The essay discusses why this definition is preferable to alternatives and how it aligns with the company's goals of finding successful and happy employees.\n\nOverall, the essay is responsive to the prompt and offers a specific, defensible answer to the question posed.\n\n## Word Count Analysis\n\nThe essay appears to be within the 1500-word limit. It covers the key aspects of the question without unnecessary verbosity, though some sections (particularly the objections and responses) could be developed more fully given the word constraint."

         "Excellent work! Your essay presents a clear, persuasive argument against the objectivity of recidivism risk assessment tools like COMPAS. Your analysis of how subjective decisions influence these tools at multiple levels—from defining recidivism to selecting fairness metrics—demonstrates sophisticated critical thinking and thorough understanding of the material.\n\nI particularly appreciated how you anticipated counterarguments and addressed them directly. Your explanation of how different interpretations of fairness can be mutually exclusive was especially insightful.\n\nFor future essays, consider developing your conceptual definitions more explicitly. While you effectively work with an implicit definition of \"objectivity\" as the absence of subjective decision-making and bias, a more thorough examination of what objectivity means in this context could have added even more depth to your already strong argument.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent piece of philosophical writing that demonstrates clear thinking, strong argumentation, and sophisticated engagement with the course material.

         "Let me analyze this essay according to the rubric provided.\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nKey quotes related to thesis:\n- \"However, a closer examination of the processes behind such algorithms demonstrates that this apparent objectivity is an illusion, and that true objectivity is impossible.\"\n- \"Therefore, the criteria for objectivity are not fulfilled and COMPAS is not objective.\"\n- \"Given that the tool's true outcomes are a reinforcement of biases, and not an accurate reflection of reality, it would be prudent to consider ceasing the use of COMPAS altogether until these issues can be resolved.\"\n\nThe essay presents a clear thesis that directly answers the question about whether data-driven recidivism risk assessment tools are objective. The student takes a decisive position that these tools are not objective. The thesis is stated early in the introduction, restated in the argument section, and reinforced in the conclusion. The language is direct and unambiguous.\n\nPreliminary assessment for Thesis: Excellent\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nKey quotes related to argument validity:\n- \"Opponents of the claim that COMPAS is objective agree with its proponents that a tool can be objective if it does not involve subjective decision-making and human biases.\"\n- \"There are several points at which subjective decisions were made and human bias bled into the model: its definition of recidivism, the measurement of relevant characteristics, and the selected interpretation of fairness.\"\n- \"Fundamentally, both are a rejection of the second premise in the above argument: if a tool's design allows it to be influenced by human bias or subjective decisions, then it is not objective.\"\n\nThe essay constructs a valid argument with explicitly stated premises:\n1. A tool is objective if it does not involve subjective decision-making and human biases.\n2. If a tool's design allows it to be influenced by human bias or subjective decisions, then it is not objective.\n3. COMPAS involves subjective decisions and human biases in its design and operation through:\n   a. Its definition of recidivism as \"a new arrest within two years\"\n   b. The measurement of relevant characteristics through subjective surveys\n   c. The selected interpretation of fairness\n4. Therefore, COMPAS is not objective.\n\nThe conclusion follows logically from the premises. The student also anticipates counterarguments from COMPAS supporters and addresses them directly. The normative premises are clearly stated, and the connection between premises and conclusion is well-established.\n\nPreliminary assessment for Argument Validity: Excellent\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nKey quotes related to understanding:\n- \"As Hardt and Recht described, data about relevant characteristics – those given to the model for its training data – was gathered from defendants via surveys.\"\n- \"Barocas and Boyd contrast two perspectives on the algorithm's fairness: one from a critic who identifies a large discrepancy in error rates between Black and white defendants...\"\n- \"...as described by Jacobs and Wallach. In the United States, \"False arrests\" tend to disproportionately affect Black people.\"\n\nThe essay references several texts and authors (Jacobs and Wallach, Hardt and Recht, Barocas and Boyd) and accurately summarizes their positions in the student's own words. The summaries appear accurate and relevant to the argument being developed. The student effectively integrates these sources to support different aspects of their argument rather than relying on quotes. The explanation of different fairness interpretations shows a sophisticated understanding of the course material.\n\nPreliminary assessment for Understanding: Excellent\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nKey quotes related to analysis, structure, and clarity:\n- \"There are several points at which subjective decisions were made and human bias bled into the model: its definition of recidivism, the measurement of relevant characteristics, and the selected interpretation of fairness.\"\n- \"The first is the survey itself – ultimately, the question of what to include must be answered by value judgments. The second is from the responses, as there is no way to guarantee that defendants answered every question with perfect accuracy.\"\n- \"I would respond to such criticisms by stating that the value of objectivity in prediction models is to allow the models to better reflect reality – a statement on which both sides are likely to agree.\"\n\nThe essay has a clear structure with an introduction, main argument, detailed supporting points, counterarguments, and a conclusion. The problem is broken down into suitable parts (definition of recidivism, measurement of characteristics, interpretation of fairness), and each part is analyzed with an appropriate level of detail. The analysis is focused and progresses logically.\n\nThe student clearly identifies the key components of the argument against COMPAS's objectivity and examines each with suitable depth. The essay also engages with potential counterarguments and addresses them directly. The language is clear and precise, and the structure helps guide the reader through the argument.\n\nPreliminary assessment for Analysis, Structure, and Clarity: Excellent\n\n## Main Argument\n\nThe main argument presented in the essay is that data-driven recidivism risk assessment tools like COMPAS are not objective because they involve subjective decisions and human biases at multiple points in their design and operation.\n\n## Supporting Points\n\n1. The definition of recidivism as \"a new arrest within two years\" is problematic because arrests are an imperfect proxy for criminal behavior and are influenced by racial biases in policing.\n\n2. The data collection process involves subjective decisions about what characteristics to measure and relies on potentially inaccurate self-reporting by defendants.\n\n3. The interpretation of fairness used in designing the tool is based on a subjective value judgment, as different valid interpretations of fairness exist but are mutually exclusive.\n\n4. The apparent objectivity of algorithms is illusory because human biases are embedded within the system's design and data.\n\n5. True objectivity in such tools is impossible due to the necessity of making subjective design decisions.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\nThe essay presents a strong, valid argument against the objectivity of recidivism risk assessment tools. The premises are explicitly stated, and the conclusion follows logically from them. The student effectively uses examples and references to support their claims.\n\nThe argument about the problematic definition of recidivism is particularly strong. The student clearly explains how using arrests as a proxy for reoffending allows racial biases in policing to affect the tool's predictions.\n\nThe discussion of different interpretations of fairness is sophisticated and demonstrates a deep understanding of the material. The student correctly notes that different valid interpretations of fairness are mutually exclusive, requiring a subjective choice between them.\n\nThe essay might have benefited from a more explicit discussion of what \"objectivity\" means in this context. While the student implicitly defines it as the absence of subjective decision-making and human biases, a more thorough examination of this concept could have strengthened the argument.\n\n## Assessment of Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear and logical structure that effectively supports the argument. It begins with an introduction that sets up the problem and states the thesis, then proceeds to a general argument against objectivity, followed by detailed supporting points. The essay then addresses potential counterarguments before concluding. This structure helps the reader follow the argument and understand the significance of each point.\n\nLanguage: The language is clear, precise, and academic in tone. The student effectively explains complex concepts like different interpretations of fairness in accessible terms without oversimplifying.\n\nExamples: The essay effectively uses examples to illustrate points, particularly in explaining how racial biases in arrests can affect the tool's predictions and how different interpretations of fairness lead to different assessments of the tool's performance.\n\nFocus: The essay maintains a clear focus on the question of objectivity in recidivism risk assessment tools. All parts of the essay contribute to addressing this central question, and the student avoids irrelevant digressions.\n\n## How Well the Essay Addresses the Assigned Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the assigned question: \"Data-driven tools for recidivism risk assessment operationalize recidivism as 'a new arrest within two years.' Proponents of such tools claim that such risk assessment tools are objective. Are they?\"\n\nThe student clearly states their position (that these tools are not objective) and provides a thorough, well-structured argument to support this position. The essay engages with the specific concern mentioned in the question (the operationalization of recidivism as \"a new arrest within two years\") and explains why this is problematic.\n\nThe essay goes beyond a simple yes/no answer to provide a nuanced analysis of why objectivity is impossible in such tools and what the implications of this are. The student also shows they understand the position of those who claim these tools are objective and addresses potential counterarguments.\n\nOverall, the essay fully and directly addresses the assigned question with a thoughtful, well-supported argument.\n\nIn terms of the word limit (1500 words), the essay appears to be within the appropriate length, allowing for sufficient depth of engagement with the literature while maintaining focus on the key arguments."

The thesis is later expanded: \"The definition of fairness employed by the hiring team depends on the group being judged, which directly correlates to early and late stages of the ATS pipeline.\"\n\nWhile the thesis does take a decisive position, it appears after several premises rather than being prominently stated at the beginning, which slightly reduces clarity. The essay would benefit from a more explicit upfront statement of this position before presenting the supporting premises.",
         "### Argument Validity\nThe essay structures the argument with four explicit premises that logically support the conclusion:\n\n1. \"Methods of defining and achieving fairness are tools – they have strengths and weaknesses.\"\n2. \"Due to the Kleinberg–Chouldekova Impossibility Theorem, equalised odds and predictive parity are not compatible given differing base rates among groups.\"\n3. \"While causal matching presents an interesting mitigation...resumes alone often do not provide enough information to identify structured and actionable causal variables.\"\n4. \"ATS uses a pipeline whose stages have different contextual requirements that affect which fairness definition is most appropriate.\"\n\nThe key normative premise is present (different contexts require different fairness metrics), and the conclusion follows logically.

There are some minor imprecisions, particularly in mathematical formulations, but the overall understanding of key concepts is sound.",

In later stages, predictive parity is the more suitable as a metric of fairness.\"\n\nWhile the structure follows a logical progression, some parts would benefit from greater elaboration, particularly regarding how fairness metrics should be implemented at specific pipeline stages.

         "## 1. Thesis Analysis\n\nLet me identify the thesis in the essay:\n\n> \"Argument: The firm should define \"fair\" based on the stage of the ATS pipeline.\"\n\nAnd later expanded with more detail:\n\n> \"The definition of fairness employed by the hiring team depends on the group being judged, which directly correlates to early and late stages of the ATS pipeline.\"\n\nThe thesis is stated somewhat clearly, though it comes after several premises are laid out. The student argues that when using ML and NLP in applicant tracking software, different definitions of fairness should be applied at different stages of the hiring pipeline. Specifically, they advocate for using \"equalized odds\" in earlier stages and \"predictive parity\" in later stages.\n\nThe thesis does directly answer the question of how a firm should use ML and NLP to screen resumes while maintaining fairness. However, it could be more explicitly stated upfront and developed with greater clarity throughout.\n\nAssessment: **Good** - The thesis is present but could be more explicitly stated early in the essay.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity Analysis\n\nThe student structures their argument with 4 explicit premises:\n\n1. \"Methods of defining and achieving fairness are tools – they have strengths and weaknesses. The two main methods (equalised odds, predictive parity) are considered 'fair' in respect to the context in which they are applied.\"\n\n2. \"Due to the Kleinberg–Chouldekova Impossibility Theorem, equalised odds and predictive parity are not compatible given differing base rates among groups.\"\n\n3. \"While causal matching presents an interesting mitigation to the Kleinberg–Chouldekova Impossibility Theorem, resumes alone often do not provide enough information to identify structured and actionable causal variables.\"\n\n4. \"ATS uses a pipeline whose stages have different contextual requirements that affect which fairness definition is most appropriate.\"\n\nThese premises lead to the conclusion that fairness should be defined differently based on the stage of the ATS pipeline.\n\nThe student attempts to use mathematical equations to formalize concepts of separation and sufficiency, though some mathematical formulations seem incomplete or contain errors (e.g., the bare \"y.\" that appears a few times).\n\nKey normative premises are present - specifically that fairness methods should be chosen based on context and that earlier stages should favor equalizing odds to avoid perpetuating historical biases.\n\nThe connection between premises and conclusion is reasonably clear, though the explanation of why different fairness definitions are appropriate at different stages could be more robustly developed.\n\nAssessment: **Good** - Most premises are explicit; there is a clear connection between premises and conclusion, though some premises could be more thoroughly developed.\n\n## 3. Understanding Analysis\n\nThe student demonstrates understanding of key concepts related to ML fairness:\n\n> \"For separation, we use \"equalised odds\" (EO) to create a situation where each group has the same error rates, such that both the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) are equal across groups.\"\n\n> \"For sufficiency, predictive parity (PP) is established by observing the positive predictive value (PPV) across groups.\"\n\nThe student also accurately references the Kleinberg-Chouldekova Impossibility Theorem:\n\n> \"From this result, we observe the Kleinberg–Chouldekova Impossibility Theorem in action – for both equalised odds and predictive parity to hold, the base rates must be equal.\"\n\nThe essay references works by \"Kleinberg et al., Barocas et al., and Beigang\" though it doesn't provide detailed citations. The student attempts to summarize these works in their own words rather than relying on quotes.\n\nThere seems to be some understanding of Beigang's proposed solution of \"causal matching,\" though the explanation is somewhat brief:\n\n> \"It is also important to touch on Beigang's proposed solution to the Impossibility Theorem – causal matching. While this method may be applicable in a data-rich context, I argue that resumes do not provide enough information to create suitable covariates which accurately capture the factors influencing the outcome prediction.\"\n\nThe student's understanding of ML/NLP concepts is generally sound, though there are some areas where greater precision would be helpful.\n\nAssessment: **Good** - Generally accurate summaries with some imprecisions; mostly in student's own words.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity Analysis\n\nThe essay breaks down the problem into parts:\n1. Understanding fairness definitions\n2. The mathematical incompatibility of different fairness metrics\n3. The limitations of causal matching with resume data\n4. The stages of the ATS pipeline and different fairness requirements\n5. Drawbacks to the proposed approach\n\nThe structure follows a logical progression, beginning with a description of the problem, then presenting premises, and finally making recommendations with acknowledgment of limitations.\n\nThere are some clarity issues, particularly with the mathematical notations which seem incomplete in places (e.g., \"y.\" appears several times). Some parts would benefit from greater elaboration, particularly the explanation of how exactly the fairness metrics should be implemented at different pipeline stages.\n\nThe analysis of the ATS pipeline stages is somewhat superficial:\n\n> \"At earlier stages of the process, ensuring the algorithm does not favour one group over the other based on error rates alone is crucial (equalised odds)... In later stages, predictive parity is the more suitable as a metric of fairness.\"\n\nThe student could have provided more detailed analysis of specific stages and how each fairness metric would be applied.\n\nThe concluding paragraphs where drawbacks are addressed show good critical thinking but are somewhat brief:\n\n> \"Chief among them is the potential for imbalance, wherein one method takes precedence over the other. For example, using two methods (which perform different on the metric of accuracy) may \"cancel out\" the perceived benefit of trying to increase selection accuracy with predictive parity.\"\n\nAssessment: **Good** - Reasonable breakdown of problem; some parts analyzed more thoroughly than others.\n\n## Main Argument and Supporting Points\n\nThe main argument is that firms should apply different fairness metrics at different stages of the applicant tracking system pipeline.\n\nSupporting points:\n1. Different fairness metrics (equalised odds and predictive parity) have different strengths and weaknesses\n2. These metrics cannot be simultaneously satisfied due to the Kleinberg-Chouldekova Impossibility Theorem\n3. At early stages, equalised odds prevents reinforcing historical inequities\n4. At later stages with smaller applicant pools, predictive parity is more appropriate\n5. The approach has drawbacks including potential imbalance between methods\n\n## Critique of Logical Consistency\n\nThe argument is generally logically consistent but has some weaknesses:\n\n1. The essay doesn't fully explain why equalised odds is specifically better for early stages beyond stating it prevents reinforcing historical inequities.\n\n2. The transition from mathematical formulations to practical recommendations has gaps - how exactly would these metrics be implemented in practice?\n\n3. The argument about causal matching not working with resume data is asserted but not thoroughly demonstrated.\n\n4. The essay notes that using different fairness metrics at different stages could create an \"imbalance\" but doesn't fully explore the implications of this.\n\n5. There's limited discussion of how the recommendations would actually achieve the goal of identifying \"happy\" and \"successful\" employees.\n\n## Structure, Language, Examples Assessment\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear structure with premises leading to a conclusion. However, the thesis could be more prominently stated at the beginning.\n\nLanguage: The language is generally clear though technical. Some mathematical notations appear incomplete.\n\nExamples: The essay is somewhat lacking in concrete examples. It discusses concepts abstractly but doesn't provide specific scenarios or case studies of how the recommended approach would work in practice.\n\nFocus: The essay maintains focus on the question of fairness in ML/NLP for resume screening, though it could more directly address how the proposed approach would help identify \"happy\" and \"successful\" employees as mentioned in the original question.\n\n## Addressing the Assigned Topic\n\nThe essay addresses the assigned topic of using ML and NLP to screen resumes while maintaining fairness. It provides a nuanced approach to fairness by recognizing different definitions and contexts.\n\nHowever, the essay could more directly address how its recommendations would help identify \"happy\" and \"successful\" employees as mentioned in the original question. This aspect is somewhat neglected in favor of focusing on fairness metrics.\n\nThe word count appears to be under the 1500 word limit, which may partly explain why some aspects aren't developed as fully as they could be.\n\nOverall, the essay demonstrates good understanding of fairness concepts in ML but could provide more concrete examples and practical guidance on implementation."

Thesis\n\nLet's identify the thesis statement in the essay:\n\n> \"In this essay, I argue that counterfactual fairness should be the guiding principle in the design of machine learning based hiring systems.\"\n\nAnother important part of the thesis:\n\n> \"A company should adopt a definition of fairness that is grounded in counterfactual fairness, which ensures applicants are carefully evaluated without the influence of systematic biases embedded in historical hiring practices.\"\n\nThe student clearly states that counterfactual fairness should be the definition of fairness that the company adopts for its ML hiring system. This is a decisive answer to the question. The thesis is clearly stated in the introduction paragraph. \n\nPreliminary assessment: **Excellent** - The thesis clearly answers the question decisively.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nLet me identify the main premises and conclusion in the argument:\n\n1. ML systems learn from flawed human decisions that contain historical biases\n   > \"Because machine learning is made to learn from flawed human decisions, we need to actively correct biases that exist in data and design artificial intelligence systems that promote fairness.\"\n\n2. Counterfactual fairness ensures individuals are treated the same regardless of socially sensitive attributes\n   > \"As we discussed in the lecture, counterfactual fairness ensures that individuals are treated the same regardless of socially sensitive attributes.\"\n\n3. True fairness requires dismantling discriminatory structures, not just removing protected attributes\n   > \"It is evident that true fairness requires the complete dismantle of structures set in place, that allow for discrimination to persist under the disguise of efficiency and objectivity. In other words, a \"fair\" artificial intelligence system is not one that only \"removes race or gender\" from the equation, it must account for past discrimination and work to correct it.\"\n\n4. Accuracy in hiring should be redefined to include fairness, not just predictive performance\n   > \"The reality is that most hiring models reflect historical inequities, which means that their \"accuracy\" is typically built on unfair and discriminatory patterns.\"\n\nConclusion: Counterfactual fairness should be adopted, along with human oversight and structural changes to hiring practices.\n\nThe student provides several premises that lead to their conclusion about adopting counterfactual fairness. They make explicit normative claims about what fairness should entail and why counterfactual fairness meets these requirements. However, there are some gaps in the logical progression. For instance, the student doesn't fully explain how counterfactual fairness specifically addresses the problem of historical biases compared to other fairness definitions. There are some connections between premises and conclusion that could be more explicitly established.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good** - Most premises are explicit, but some connections between premises and conclusion could be strengthened. The key normative premise about what fairness should entail is present.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nThe student references the work of Benjamin (2019) and Johnson (2020) throughout the essay:\n\n> \"Benjamin (2019) addresses the extent to this critique, by introducing the concept of the New Jim Code. This New Jim Code is no more than a sly way in which apparent neutral technologies encode and perpetuate racial hierarchies.\"\n\n> \"As mentioned by Johnson (2020), there is no purely algorithmic fix to bias.\"\n\n> \"A major concept that Johnson (2020) brings to light is the garbage in, garbage out issue; if an algorithm learns from biased hiring data, its predictions will perpetuate those biases.\"\n\nThe student does seem to understand the key concepts from these authors, such as the \"New Jim Code\" and \"garbage in, garbage out\" issues in algorithmic systems. They use these concepts to support their argument about counterfactual fairness. However, there's somewhat limited explanation of what counterfactual fairness specifically means in technical terms. The student mentions that it \"ensures that individuals are treated the same regardless of socially sensitive attributes,\" but doesn't go into much detail about how it's implemented or how it differs from other fairness definitions that might also aim to achieve this goal.\n\nThere are no major misunderstandings of the referenced texts, though the student could have provided a more comprehensive explanation of counterfactual fairness as a technical concept.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good** - Generally accurate summaries with perhaps some minor misunderstandings or lack of depth in explaining counterfactual fairness technically.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nThe essay is structured with clear sections:\n1. Introduction with thesis\n2. \"The Inescapable Reality of Bias in Algorithmic Hiring\"\n3. \"Implementing Fairness Beyond the Algorithm\"\n4. \"Confronting the Tradeoff Myth and Ethical Responsibilities\"\n5. \"The Call for Justice-Oriented Hiring\"\n\nThe student breaks down the problem into suitable parts:\n- The issue of bias in historical data\n- The need for counterfactual fairness\n- Implementation challenges beyond algorithms\n- The false tradeoff between fairness and accuracy\n- The broader call for justice-oriented design\n\nThe structure is logical and the sections flow reasonably well. However, some parts are analyzed more thoroughly than others. For instance, the technical aspects of counterfactual fairness are not explored in great detail, while more space is devoted to general issues of bias in AI.\n\nThere are some minor issues with clarity and language (typos, grammatical errors), but these don't significantly impede understanding. For example:\n> \"bias and racism manifest in algorithmic systems, in which I argue that fairness cannot be achieved through mathematical adjustments alone\"\n> \"gatekeeping mechanisms can be used in various contexts like social media and j journalism\"\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good** - Reasonable breakdown of the problem with some parts analyzed more thoroughly than others. The structure is clear but there's some imbalance in the depth of analysis across different aspects of the problem.\n\n## Main Argument and Supporting Points\n\nMain Argument: A company should adopt counterfactual fairness as its definition of fairness in ML-based hiring systems, which requires not just algorithmic adjustments but structural changes to address historical biases.\n\nSupporting Points:\n1. ML systems learn from and perpetuate historical biases in hiring data\n2. Variables that appear neutral often serve as proxies for protected attributes\n3. True fairness requires addressing systemic inequities, not just removing protected attributes from algorithms\n4. There's a false tradeoff between fairness and accuracy; models that perpetuate bias aren't truly \"accurate\"\n5. Implementation of fairness requires human oversight, diverse teams, and ongoing audits\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\nThe student's argument about the need to address historical biases in ML systems is valid and well-supported. They correctly identify that simply removing protected attributes isn't sufficient because of proxy variables that correlate with those attributes.\n\nHowever, there are some weaknesses in the argument:\n\n1. The student doesn't clearly explain why counterfactual fairness is superior to other fairness definitions (like demographic parity, equal opportunity, etc.). They assert it's the best definition without fully comparing alternatives.\n\n2. There's limited discussion of the practical challenges in implementing counterfactual fairness. For example, determining the causal model required for counterfactual fairness can be complex.\n\n3. The essay sometimes blends normative claims about what should be done with descriptive claims about how systems currently work, without always distinguishing between them.\n\n4. Some claims are asserted rather than argued for, such as: \"It is evident that true fairness requires the complete dismantle of structures set in place.\" This statement could benefit from more supporting evidence or reasoning.\n\n## Structure, Language, Use of Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear structure with an introduction, several thematic sections, and a conclusion. The organization is logical, but transitions between some sections could be smoother.\n\nLanguage: The language is generally clear, though there are some grammatical issues and typos. These don't significantly impede understanding but do affect the essay's polish.\n\nExamples: The student provides some examples of how bias manifests in hiring algorithms, such as:\n- The example of how \"past hiring managers executives have had a history of disproportionately excluding Black women from leadership roles\"\n- The example of education from top universities being used as a false primary indicator of merit\n\nHowever, the essay could benefit from more specific, concrete examples of how counterfactual fairness would be implemented in practice or how it has been successfully applied in similar contexts.\n\nFocus: The essay stays focused on the question of what definition of fairness a company should adopt, though it expands beyond just the definition to include implementation considerations. This broader focus is appropriate given the complexity of the issue.\n\n## How Well the Essay Addresses the Question\n\nThe question asked: \"What definition of fairness should the company take, and why?\"\n\nThe essay directly answers this question by advocating for counterfactual fairness and providing several reasons why this definition is appropriate. The student goes beyond just describing counterfactual fairness to discuss implementation challenges and contextualizes it within broader social justice concerns.\n\nHowever, the essay could more explicitly compare counterfactual fairness to alternative definitions to strengthen the argument for why this particular definition is best. The explanation of what counterfactual fairness actually entails in technical terms could also be more detailed.\n\nOverall, the essay addresses the assigned question well but could be strengthened with more technical detail and comparative analysis.\n\n## Word Count Considerations\n\nThe essay appears to be close to the 1500-word limit based on its length. Given this constraint, the student has made reasonable choices about what to include, though as noted above, some technical details and comparative analysis of fairness definitions had to be sacrificed.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe essay presents a clear thesis advocating for counterfactual fairness in ML-based hiring systems. The argument is mostly valid, with explicit premises leading to the conclusion, though some connections could be strengthened. The student demonstrates good understanding of the referenced texts and concepts, but could provide more technical detail about counterfactual fairness itself. The essay has a clear structure that breaks down the problem appropriately, though some aspects receive more thorough analysis than others. Overall, the essay directly addresses the question while expanding appropriately to implementation considerations."

It is explicit, well-positioned in the introduction, and sets up the argument that follows.",
         "# Argument Validity\nThe essay constructs a valid argument with explicitly stated premises that connect logically to the conclusion. The main argument follows this structure:\n1.

Equal error rates balance fairness with merit-based hiring\n4. Therefore, the separation criterion is most suitable\n\nThe student provides supporting reasoning: \"Equal distribution of errors prevents groups of qualified candidates from being disproportionately rejected from the hiring process\" and \"Equalizing error rates instead of the independence criterion's approach of equalizing selection rates ensures that qualified candidates are selected fairly on account of merit.\"\n\nThe essay also addresses counterarguments: \"The Separation Criterion Does Not Address Structural Bias in Merit and Hiring Outcomes\" and provides a rebuttal.\n\nHowever, the essay has a few logical gaps:\n- The sufficiency criterion is defined but not thoroughly addressed in the comparison\n- Some assumptions about company objectives aren't fully justified\n- The connection between procedural fairness and company goals could be more developed",

         "# Analysis of the Student Essay\n\nFirst, let me identify what the essay question is asking:\n- The question asks the student to recommend which definition of fairness a company should adopt for an ML system that screens resumes, and to explain why this definition is appropriate.\n\nNow, let's analyze the essay using the rubric criteria:\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nRelevant quotes:\n- \"I argue that the company should adopt the equalized odds parity (separation criterion) as a definition for fairness when implementing a model for screening candidates.\"\n- \"This definition of fairness is uniquely suited to the objectives of the company because it balances fairness and merit-based hiring, while also ensuring fair distribution of errors.\"\n\nThe thesis is clearly stated in the introduction. The student takes a decisive position by recommending the separation criterion (equalized odds parity) as the fairness definition the company should adopt. The student also previews the main reasons for this choice: balancing fairness with merit-based hiring and ensuring fair distribution of errors.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Excellent**. The thesis directly answers the question and takes a clear position.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nThe main argument seems to be:\n1. The separation criterion ensures equal error rates across demographic groups\n2. Equal error rates reduce systematic discrimination against qualified candidates\n3. Equal error rates balance fairness considerations with merit-based hiring\n4. Therefore, the separation criterion is the most suitable definition of fairness for the company\n\nSupporting premises and reasoning:\n- \"Equal distribution of errors prevents groups of qualified candidates from being disproportionately rejected from the hiring process.\"\n- \"Applying the separation criterion ensures that all genders face the same false rejection rate.\"\n- \"Equalizing error rates instead of the independence criterion's approach of equalizing selection rates ensures that qualified candidates are selected fairly on account of merit rather than solely on group membership.\"\n- \"The independence criterion's pitfalls [include creating] arbitrary quotas for demographic groups, forcing the company to waste resources to interview and potentially hire underqualified candidates.\"\n\nThe student also presents a counterargument and response:\n- Counterargument: \"The Separation Criterion Does Not Address Structural Bias in Merit and Hiring Outcomes.\"\n- Response: \"The argument on merit is valid, but not incompatible with the separation criterion... Matching error rates could be used to compare candidates with similar qualifications across demographic groups.\"\n\nThe premises are explicitly stated, and the conclusion does follow logically from these premises. The student shows how the separation criterion addresses the goals of reducing discrimination and balancing fairness with merit, which supports the conclusion that it's the most suitable definition.\n\nHowever, there are a few gaps in the reasoning:\n1. The student assumes that the company's objectives include both fairness and merit-based hiring without fully justifying why these should be the company's goals.\n2. The comparison between fairness criteria is not complete - the sufficiency criterion (predictive parity) is defined but not thoroughly addressed in the comparison.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good**. Most premises are explicit, the key normative premise (that fairness should balance equality with merit) is present, and premises are connected to the conclusion. However, there are some minor premises missing and the analysis of the sufficiency criterion is underdeveloped.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nRelevant quotes:\n- \"Demographic Parity (independence criterion) asserts that a model is fair if group membership does not affect the classification outcomes.\"\n- \"Predictive Parity (sufficiency criterion) defines fairness as ensuring equal predictive value across groups.\"\n- \"The separation criterion identifies fairness as equal false positive and negative rates across groups.\"\n\nThe student demonstrates a good understanding of the three fairness criteria (independence, sufficiency, and separation) and accurately summarizes them in their own words. The explanations are clear and correct.\n\nThe student also references some external sources:\n- \"(Johnson, 2020) explains that ML models inherit social patterns reflected in their training data because that data can be historically biased.\"\n- \"(Beigang, 2023)'s distinction between fairness and justice: fairness is procedural, and justice is outcome oriented.\"\n- \"Judith Jarvis Thomson's perceived fairness of flipping a coin and assigning equal probability in the Trolley Bystander dilemma.\"\n\nThese references seem to be accurately used, though without the full text of the sources, I can't verify complete accuracy. The student has not relied heavily on quotes.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good**. The student shows accurate understanding of the main concepts and uses sources appropriately, though with limited depth.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nStructure analysis:\nThe essay follows a clear structure:\n1. Introduction and definitions\n2. Statement of thesis\n3. Explanation of main fairness criteria\n4. Arguments for the separation criterion (reducing discrimination, balancing fairness with merit)\n5. Evaluation of potential counterarguments\n6. Conclusion\n\nThe student breaks down the problem of fairness in ML hiring into suitable parts:\n- Understanding different fairness definitions\n- Analyzing how these definitions affect discrimination\n- Examining trade-offs between fairness and merit\n- Addressing potential criticisms\n\nThe analysis is generally focused and logical, with appropriate transitions between sections. The student maintains a clear focus on the central question throughout.\n\nLevel of detail:\n- Good detail on the separation criterion and its benefits\n- Adequate detail on the independence criterion and its weaknesses\n- Limited detail on the sufficiency criterion (mentioned briefly but not analyzed)\n\nUse of examples:\n- \"For instance, if 20% of qualified female candidates are rejected, while only 5% of qualified males are rejected, the model exhibits gender bias.\"\n- \"For instance, if the model's training data contains fewer qualified candidates of color...\"\n- \"For instance, if the model has already selected 15% of White candidates, 15% of Latino candidates, and 25% of Black candidates, an additional qualified Black candidate could be falsely rejected...\"\n- \"In the example of race and Ivy League graduates...\"\n\nThese examples help illustrate the student's points effectively.\n\nClarity:\nThe writing is generally clear, though there are a few minor typos and grammatical issues:\n- \"fofor making hiring decisions\"\n- \"arbrbitrary quotas\"\n- Some spacing issues after periods\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good**. The essay has a reasonable breakdown of the problem with focused analysis, though some parts (particularly the sufficiency criterion) are analyzed less thoroughly than others.\n\n## Overall Assessment of How Well the Essay Addresses the Assigned Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the assigned question, which asks what definition of fairness the company should adopt for its ML resume screening system and why. The student clearly recommends the separation criterion and provides substantive arguments for this choice.\n\nThe student effectively:\n1. Defines the relevant fairness criteria\n2. Makes a clear recommendation (separation criterion)\n3. Provides reasons for this recommendation (reducing discrimination, balancing fairness and merit)\n4. Addresses potential counterarguments\n5. Places the discussion in the context of a company's hiring goals\n\nMain Argument: The separation criterion (equalized odds parity) is the most suitable definition of fairness for the company's ML resume screening system because it reduces systematic discrimination while balancing fairness with merit-based hiring.\n\nSupporting Points:\n1. Equal error rates prevent qualified candidates from being disproportionately rejected based on demographic group\n2. The separation criterion can help break cycles of historical bias in hiring data\n3. Unlike demographic parity, the separation criterion doesn't force arbitrary quotas that may undermine merit-based hiring\n4. The separation criterion aligns with procedural fairness appropriate for a private company context\n5. Equal error rates distribute fairness in a way comparable to equal probability in ethical thought experiments\n\nCritical Examination of Arguments:\n1. The reducing discrimination argument is generally sound, though it assumes that equal error rates across groups will be achievable in practice.\n2. The balancing fairness with merit argument is valid but could be strengthened with more discussion of why merit should be a primary consideration for the company.\n3. The counterargument about structural bias is well-addressed, though the response could be more developed.\n4. The distinction between fairness and justice is useful but could be expanded further to strengthen the argument.\n\nThe essay's treatment of the question is comprehensive and thoughtful, though it could go deeper in some areas, particularly in analyzing the sufficiency criterion and in developing the counterarguments more fully."

This is the case as the data itself is based in social biases, subjective assumptions, and measurement errors that serve to undermine any trace of objectivity.\" The thesis directly addresses the prompt question and provides a roadmap for the argument that follows.",
         "Argument Validity\nThe essay presents a generally valid argument with most premises explicitly stated. The main argument can be reconstructed as follows: (1) objectivity requires faithfulness to facts, value-freedom, and absence of bias; (2) the operationalization of recidivism introduces biases; (3) these biases undermine construct validity; therefore, (4) recidivism risk assessment tools are not objective.\n\nThe key normative premise regarding what constitutes objectivity is present: \"Objectivity can be thought about in three different ways: (1) faithfulness to facts, (2) value-freedom, and (3) absence of personal bias.\" The essay then logically connects this to the conclusion through an analysis of how measurement and social construction affect these criteria.\n\nHowever, some connections between premises could be more explicitly drawn, and there are occasional clarity issues in expressing the logical flow.

         "Let me analyze this essay based on the provided rubric.\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nKey sentences related to the thesis:\n- \"The purpose of this paper is to argue in the dissent, maintaining that data-driven risk assessment tools, such as recidivism predictors, are not objective.\"\n- \"While these tools may seem objective due to their reliance on statistical models and grounding in quantitative data, I argue it is only such at face value.\"\n- \"This is the case as the data itself is based in social biases, subjective assumptions, and measurement errors that serve to undermine any trace of objectivity.\"\n\nThe essay has a clearly stated thesis that directly answers the question \"Are data-driven tools for recidivism risk assessment objective?\" with a clear position: no, they are not objective. The thesis appears early in the essay and explains the main argument that will be developed. The author takes a decisive stance against the objectivity of these tools.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent - The thesis is clearly stated and takes a decisive position on the question.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nThe main argument can be reconstructed as follows:\nPremise 1: Objectivity requires faithfulness to facts, value-freedom, and absence of personal bias.\nPremise 2: Data-driven recidivism risk assessment tools rely on measurements that are socially constructed.\nPremise 3: The operationalization of recidivism as \"a new arrest within two years\" introduces biases (e.g., racial bias in policing).\nPremise 4: These biases undermine construct validity (including content validity, face validity, and consequential validity).\nConclusion: Therefore, data-driven risk assessment tools for recidivism are not objective.\n\nKey sentences related to argument validity:\n- \"Objectivity can be thought about in three different ways: (1) faithfulness to facts, (2) value-freedom, and (3) absence of personal bias.\"\n- \"The process of the operationalization, making the measurement, inherently involves assumptions and choices that are likely to introduce some sort of bias.\"\n- \"In this example, of recidivism risk assessments, the construct validity this may rightfully be questioned since the operationalization the level of recidivism as 'a new arrest within two years' does not account for a multitude of vital factors.\"\n\nThe essay states most of its premises explicitly and connects them to the conclusion. The student clearly establishes what objectivity means, explains how measurements introduce bias, and shows how this undermines the claim of objectivity. There is a logical connection between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nHowever, there are some grammar and clarity issues in parts of the argument, and some of the connections between premises could be more explicitly drawn out.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - Most premises are explicit, and there is a clear connection between premises and conclusion, though some clarity issues exist.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nKey sentences related to understanding:\n- \"Jacobs and Wallach outline the importance of construct validity, assessing if a measurement accurately captures the intended construct or not.\"\n- \"As Hardt and Recht point out, the process of turning real-world phenomena into numerical data (quantization) involves choices that can introduce bias.\"\n- \"As Jacobs and Wallach point out, construct reliability is only one aspect of measurement quality.\"\n\nThe essay references several texts and authors (Jacobs and Wallach, Hardt and Recht) and demonstrates understanding of key concepts like construct validity, measurement error, and social construction of data. The summaries of these concepts appear to be in the student's own words rather than direct quotes.\n\nThere's evidence that the student understands the relationship between measurement and objectivity, as well as how social biases can be embedded in data. The student also addresses counterarguments, showing an understanding of alternative perspectives.\n\nHowever, there could be more specific details from the referenced texts to support the arguments more thoroughly.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - The essay demonstrates understanding of key concepts and texts, but could provide more detailed engagement with the sources.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nThe essay is organized into clear sections:\n1. Introduction and thesis\n2. Defining objectivity and its challenges\n3. The role of measurement and construct validity\n4. Social construction of data and implications\n5. Addressing counterarguments\n6. Conclusion\n\nKey sentences related to analysis, structure, and clarity:\n- \"Defining Objectivity and its Challenges in Data Science:\"\n- \"The Role of Measurement and Construct Validity:\"\n- \"Social Construction of Data and its Implications:\"\n- \"Addressing Counterarguments:\"\n\nThe essay breaks down the problem of objectivity in recidivism risk assessment tools into suitable parts, analyzing different aspects of the issue (definition of objectivity, measurement problems, social construction of data). The structure is logical and flows well.\n\nExamples are provided, particularly in discussing racial bias in policing and the COMPAS tool. However, some examples could be more detailed or concrete to strengthen the analysis.\n\nThere are occasional grammar and clarity issues, such as: \"In this example, of recidivism risk assessments, the construct validity this may rightfully be questioned...\" which affects readability.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - The essay has a clear structure and breaks down the problem appropriately, but some sections could benefit from more detailed analysis and clearer expression.\n\n## Main Argument and Supporting Points\n\nThe main argument is that data-driven tools for recidivism risk assessment are not objective because they rely on socially constructed data and measurements that introduce various biases.\n\nSupporting points:\n1. The operationalization of recidivism as \"a new arrest within two years\" introduces bias due to racial disparities in policing.\n2. The construct validity of these measurements is questionable because arrests are not a reliable proxy for criminal behavior.\n3. The social construction of data means that the training data reflects societal biases rather than objective reality.\n4. The consequential validity is problematic as these models exacerbate racial disparities in the criminal justice system.\n5. Mathematical consistency does not ensure objectivity if the underlying data is biased.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\nThe essay presents a generally valid argument about the lack of objectivity in recidivism risk assessment tools. The connection between socially constructed measurements and a lack of objectivity is logical.\n\nStrengths:\n- The essay correctly identifies the role of operationalization in introducing bias.\n- It distinguishes between different types of validity (construct, content, face, consequential).\n- It addresses counterarguments about mathematical objectivity and consistency.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Some claims could benefit from more empirical evidence or specific examples.\n- The distinction between objectivity as \"faithfulness to facts\" and the other definitions could be more thoroughly explored.\n- The essay occasionally makes strong claims without sufficient supporting evidence (e.g., about COMPAS and racial bias).\n\n## Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear structure with distinct sections addressing different aspects of the argument. The flow is logical, moving from definitions to analysis of measurement issues to social construction of data.\n\nLanguage: The language is generally appropriate for an academic essay, though there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that affect clarity. For example: \"The process of the operationalization, making the measurement, inherently involves assumptions and choices that are likely to introduce some sort of bias.\"\n\nExamples: The essay provides some examples, particularly regarding racial bias in policing and the COMPAS tool. However, more specific examples or case studies would strengthen the argument.\n\nFocus: The essay maintains focus on the question of objectivity in recidivism risk assessment tools throughout. It stays on topic and addresses the question directly.\n\n## Addressing the Assigned Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the assigned question: \"Data-driven tools for recidivism risk assessment operationalize recidivism as 'a new arrest within two years.' Proponents of such tools claim that such risk assessment tools are objective.

         "Let me start by breaking down this essay according to the rubric criteria:\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nRelevant passages:\n- \"I will argue about, and mention fairness in terms of sufficiency and separation, which are analogous to Beigang's paper on fairness and equalized odds and predictive parity respectively. I will argue from the side of sufficiency by outlining the serious flaws that arise from relying on separation as fairness.\"\n- \"Based on the serious flaws seen in separation, it is easy to conclude that separation is not a viable option in practical applications where there is little data; however, I do not support blindly using sufficiency as the only alternative model for fairness.\"\n\nThe essay does present a thesis that suggests sufficiency is generally a better approach to fairness than separation in the context of machine learning for résumé screening, particularly when data is limited. However, the thesis could be more explicitly stated. The student doesn't make an unequivocal claim but rather presents a nuanced view that sufficiency is better in certain circumstances while acknowledging limitations of both approaches.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - Thesis present but could be more explicitly stated or isn't fully decisive\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nRelevant passages:\n- \"Out of all the issues with choosing separation, the concern about having enough data is the largest problem. Separation is data heavy and requires significantly more data than is required for sufficiency.\"\n- \"Separation seeks to reach fairness in the overall outcome, which is mentioned earlier. This is seen in recommending candidates that may not be seen as gaining the same total utility, again in this case success or happiness in a job, but the outcome of giving this higher opportunity to minorities within a specific category.\"\n- \"In the event there is misclassification for the separation model, those who are misclassified either are significantly aided by falling into a group that has a higher rate of flagging in this résumé example, or they are significantly hindered by being miscategorized as being in a group that has a lower rate of résumé flagging.\"\n\nThe student presents several premises to support their argument:\n1. Separation requires more data than sufficiency\n2. Separation can lead to misclassification problems that significantly impact individuals\n3. Separation sacrifices unified prediction power for representation\n4. Sufficiency provides the same predictive power across groups\n\nThe conclusion that sufficiency is generally better in practical applications follows logically from these premises. The student acknowledges that sufficiency has its own limitations but argues that it is still the better choice when forced between the two options.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - Most premises are explicit; the key normative premise (that equal predictive power is more important than equal representation in fairness) is present; premises are connected to the conclusion.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nRelevant passages:\n- \"To begin with, sufficiency is a version of fairness that is based on having equal prediction power across different protected categories people fall into.\"\n- \"The separation definition of fairness is based more on having similar prevalence or representation in a nominal sense, but allowing for different rates of acceptance between these protected categories.\"\n- \"I will argue about, and mention fairness in terms of sufficiency and separation, which are analogous to Beigang's paper on fairness and equalized odds and predictive parity respectively.\"\n\nThe student demonstrates a general understanding of the concepts of sufficiency and separation as fairness metrics. They reference \"Beigang's paper\" but don't provide a full citation or detailed explanation of this source. The concepts are generally explained in the student's own words, though there are some areas where more precision would be helpful.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - Generally accurate summaries with some minor misunderstandings; mostly in student's own words.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nRelevant passages:\n- \"The Difference Between Separation and Sufficiency\" (section header)\n- \"Why Separation Doesn't Work\" (section header)\n- \"Overall Assessment\" (section header)\n\nThe essay has a clear structure with defined sections that help organize the argument. The student first defines the key concepts, then presents arguments against separation, and finally provides an overall assessment. The analysis is focused on the limitations of separation and the relative advantages of sufficiency.\n\nHowever, the analysis has some imbalances. The student spends more time criticizing separation than explaining the merits of sufficiency. The essay would benefit from a more detailed examination of both approaches with examples to illustrate the points.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - Reasonable breakdown of problem; some parts analyzed more thoroughly than others.\n\n## Main Argument\n\nThe main argument of the essay is that sufficiency is a better approach to fairness in machine learning for résumé screening than separation, particularly in practical applications where data is limited.\n\n## Supporting Points\n\n1. Separation requires more data than sufficiency, making it impractical in many real-world scenarios.\n2. Separation leads to different predictive powers across groups, which can create problems especially with misclassification.\n3. Separation prioritizes representation over utility/success, which may not be optimal.\n4. Sufficiency provides consistent predictive power across different groups.\n5. While sufficiency has limitations, it is generally the more practical choice between the two options.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\nThe student's argument about data requirements for separation vs. sufficiency is reasonable but would benefit from more explanation or evidence. The claim that separation requires more data is stated but not fully justified.\n\nThe argument about misclassification problems in separation models is logical but could be strengthened with examples or more detailed explanation of the mechanisms involved.\n\nThe discussion about different predictive powers across groups in separation models effectively highlights a key limitation of this approach.\n\nThe overall argument acknowledges the limitations of both approaches, which shows nuanced thinking. However, the conclusion that sufficiency is generally better could be more decisively defended.\n\n## Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nThe essay has a clear structure with defined sections. The language is generally clear, though there are some awkward phrasings and grammatical issues.\n\nThe essay lacks concrete examples to illustrate its points. For instance, when discussing the problems with separation or the benefits of sufficiency, specific scenarios or case studies would make the arguments more compelling.\n\nThe focus is appropriate, centering on the comparison between sufficiency and separation as fairness metrics in machine learning for résumé screening. However, the student spends more time criticizing separation than explaining the merits of sufficiency.\n\n## Addressing the Question\n\nWhile the essay doesn't explicitly state what Question 3 is, it appears to be addressing a question about fairness in machine learning for résumé screening. The student effectively engages with this topic by comparing two approaches to fairness.\n\nHowever, without seeing the exact question, it's difficult to assess how directly the essay addresses all aspects of the assigned topic. The essay does provide a substantive discussion of fairness in the context specified, so it likely addresses the core of the question.\n\nOverall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the concepts and presents a reasoned argument, though it could be strengthened with more examples, more balanced analysis, and a more decisive thesis."

If a fafacial recognition system is used to racially profifile and automate policing, then the material anchors produduced by this system, such as increased surveillance in predominantly Black neighborhrhoods, are oppressive in design and effffefect.\"\n3. \"The assumption that machines are objbjective is also problematic because it allows decision-makers to outsource accountability.\"\n\nThe essay establishes several premises:\n- Data science is often perceived as objective\n- Systems rely on biased data\n- Material anchors are physical manifestations that shape cognition\n- These systems can create racist material anchors\n- The perception of neutrality shields these systems from accountability\n\nThe conclusion (that data science products can embed racist material anchors that perpetuate discrimination) follows logically from these premises. The premises are explicitly stated and connected to the conclusion. There are no obvious logical fallacies.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good to Excellent. The premises are explicit and the conclusion follows logically, though some connections could be elaborated more fully.\n\n## 3.

The summaries appear accurate and are presented primarily in the student's own words. The concept of material anchors is accurately represented, and the bidirectional nature of these anchors is correctly highlighted. The student correctly identifies Benjamin's argument about the habituation of bias.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good. The referenced texts are accurately summarized in the student's own words with no significant misinterpretations, though more depth could have been provided.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nKey sentences related to analysis, structure, and clarity:\n1. \"To To examine this argument, this papaper will fifirst defifine key concepts: racism, material anchors, and oppression. Aftfter explaining how data science systems can be biased, I will illustrate how these biases manifefest as material anchors that sustain systemic discrimination.\"\n2. \"For example, a fafacial recognition system may have higher errrror rates fofor darker-skinned people of color as a result of poor and unrepresentative data.\"\n3. \"The COMPAPAS risk assessment tool has been criticized fofor produducing biased results that are then apapplied to the physical world through the disproportionate incarceration of Black defefendants. Similarly, y, credit scoring algorithms that penalize individuduals based on residential areas results in less loan-apapprovals and fifinancial liberty fofor people of color.\"\n\nThe essay breaks down the problem into suitable parts (defining concepts, explaining biases in data science, illustrating how these biases manifest, discussing perception of neutrality, discussing accountability). The structure follows a logical progression. The essay provides concrete examples (facial recognition, COMPAS, credit scoring) to illustrate the arguments. The analysis is focused and maintains an appropriate level of detail given the word limit.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good to Excellent. The problem is broken down appropriately, and the essay provides focused analysis with good use of examples.\n\n## Main Argument\n\nThe main argument presented in the essay is that the perceived objectivity of data science, combined with biased data, creates data science products with racist material anchors embedded in their design. These anchors perpetuate discriminatory practices and reinforce existing power structures, particularly when decision-makers outsource accountability to these systems perceived as neutral.\n\n## Supporting Points\n\n1. Data science systems are based on biased or incomplete data that reflects historical inequalities.\n2. The perceived neutrality and objectivity of AI creates a false sense of security about the outputs.\n3. Material anchors produced by these systems (e.g., increased surveillance, higher incarceration rates) are physical manifestations that shape human cognition.\n4. Decision-makers outsource accountability to these systems, which shields discriminatory practices from oversight.\n5. The black-box nature of AI systems makes it difficult to challenge their outputs, further entrenching biases.\n\n## Critical Examination\n\nThe argument about data science systems inheriting biases from their training data is valid and well-supported. The essay correctly points out that historical data often reflects societal inequalities.\n\nThe connection between biased outputs and material anchors is logical. The essay effectively demonstrates how algorithmic decisions manifest in physical realities that shape cognition (surveillance equipment, incarceration, loan denials).\n\nThe concept of outsourcing accountability is valid, though the essay could more clearly explain the mechanisms by which this occurs.\n\nThe essay's argument about the false neutrality of AI is strong and supported by examples, though it could be strengthened by addressing potential counterarguments about attempts to make AI more fair.\n\nThe essay's conclusion follows logically from its premises. However, the essay could be more explicit about how the material anchors specifically function to \"sustain systemic discrimination\" beyond creating individual instances of bias.\n\n## Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear structure with an introduction, discussion, and conclusion. It outlines its approach in the introduction and follows through on that outline.\n\nLanguage: The essay employs reasonably clear language, though there are typographical issues that sometimes impede readability. The concepts are explained in accessible terms.\n\nExamples: The essay uses strong, concrete examples (facial recognition, COMPAS, credit scoring) to illustrate its arguments. These examples effectively demonstrate how biased data manifests in discriminatory outcomes.\n\nFocus: The essay maintains focus on its main argument throughout. It does not get sidetracked by tangential issues and develops its key points carefully.\n\n## Addressing the Question\n\nWhile no explicit question was provided, the essay appears to be addressing a prompt about how technology and data science can perpetuate racism through material anchors. The essay directly addresses this topic by:\n1. Defining key concepts (racism, material anchors, oppression)\n2. Explaining how data science can be biased\n3. Illustrating how these biases manifest as material anchors\n4. Discussing how neutrality perception and lack of accountability allow these anchors to perpetuate discrimination\n\nOverall, the essay appears to fully address the implicit question or topic.\n\n## Summary Assessment\n\nThesis: Good to Excellent. Clear thesis that answers the question decisively, though it could be more concisely articulated.\n\nArgument Validity: Good to Excellent. Premises are explicitly stated, and the conclusion follows logically. Connections between premises and conclusion are generally clear.\n\nUnderstanding: Good. Referenced texts are accurately summarized in the student's own words with no significant misinterpretations, though more depth could have been provided in some areas.\n\nAnalysis, Structure, and Clarity: Good to Excellent. Problem is broken down effectively, with appropriate use of examples and focused analysis.\n\nThe essay demonstrates a solid understanding of the concepts and constructs a valid argument about how data science can create racist material anchors. It provides concrete examples to illustrate its points and maintains a clear focus throughout. The main areas for improvement would be to provide more depth in its engagement with the literature and to be more explicit about the mechanisms by which material anchors perpetuate systemic discrimination."

The thesis is reinforced throughout the paper, particularly when the student states \"equalized odds is the best available approach for hiring algorithms because it actively prevents discrimination in selection while preserving some historical nuance.\"",
         "The argument is structured with most premises explicitly stated. The student argues that equalized odds is superior because: 1) it \"reduces discriminatory hiring patterns instead of locking them in,\" 2) it \"doesn't completely erase historical context,\" and 3) it \"aligns with legal and ethical hiring standards.\" The connection between premises and conclusion is clear and logical. The normative premise that hiring algorithms should reduce discrimination rather than reinforce it is present but could be more explicitly articulated. The argument that predictive parity \"assumes past hiring data is fair when it clearly isn't\" is well-reasoned and connected to the conclusion.\n\nThe essay provides a compelling example: \"Take a hiring model trained on historical data from a tech company where only 20% of past hires were women due to implicit bias... If the model is optimized for predictive parity, it will base its fairness calculations on past success rates, which are already skewed.\"",
         "The student demonstrates good understanding of the fairness metrics discussed: \"Equalized odds ensures that false positive and false negative rates are equal across demographic groups... Predictive parity ensures that once a candidate is selected, their probability of being 'successful' at the job is the same across groups.\" \n\nThe summary of Beigang's (2023) critique is accurate but could be more thorough: \"Beigang critiques fairness metrics for their tendency to flatten historical context, arguing that fairness should not just be about balancing error rates but also about understanding the causal impact of sensitive attributes like race or gender.\" The essay presents these concepts in the student's own words rather than relying on direct quotes.\n\nHowever, the student never provides full context about Beigang (2023) - what kind of publication it is or its full arguments - which limits the reader's understanding of this central source.",

         "Let me carefully analyze this student essay based on the provided rubric and guidelines. I'll start by examining each criterion, then identify the main argument and supporting points.\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nKey sentences related to thesis:\n- \"In this essay, y, I argue that the company should adopt equalized odds as its fairness metric because it mitigates disparities in hiring without erasing historical nuance.\" (from Introduction)\n- \"This paper breaks down what fairness actually means in hiring, why equalized odds is the better option, and how Beigang's (2023) critique of fairness metrics—especially around causal reasoning and decontextualization—can push companies to go beyond surface-level fixes.\" (from Introduction)\n- \"Despite the limitations of statistical fairness, equalized odds is the best available approach for hiring algorithms because it actively prevents discrimination in selection while preserving some historical nuance.\" (from \"Why Equalized Odds is the Better Choice\" section)\n\nThe essay has a clearly stated thesis that argues for equalized odds as the superior fairness metric for hiring algorithms compared to predictive parity. The thesis is decisive and explicit about taking a position on the question of which fairness definition the company should adopt. The student is clear about why they believe equalized odds is better: it mitigates disparities without erasing historical context, whereas predictive parity risks reinforcing existing biases.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Excellent** - The thesis is clearly stated and takes a decisive position on the question.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nKey premises and conclusion:\n- Premise 1: Fairness in hiring algorithms is often decontextualized and treated as a math problem rather than considering real-world histories of discrimination.\n- Premise 2: Predictive parity assumes past hiring success rates are fair, which is rarely true.\n- Premise 3: Equalized odds ensures false positive and false negative rates are equal across demographic groups.\n- Premise 4: Predictive parity can lock in historical discrimination by basing fairness on already biased success rates.\n- Normative premise: Hiring algorithms should reduce discrimination rather than reinforce it.\n- Conclusion: Equalized odds is the better fairness metric for hiring algorithms.\n\nSupporting reasons:\n1. \"Equalized odds ensures that women and men have similar false positive and false negative rates, forcing the system to stop filtering out women at a disproportionate rate.\"\n2. \"Equalized odds is still a simplified fairness metric, but it does a better job of preserving historical nuance because it ensures fair consideration, rather than just manipulating outcomes.\"\n3. \"Equalized odds aligns more closely with anti-discrimination laws than predictive parity does.\"\n\nThe argument is generally valid. The premises are explicitly stated, and the conclusion follows logically from them. The essay clearly explains why equalized odds is better than predictive parity by showing how predictive parity can reinforce bias. The normative premise (that hiring algorithms should reduce discrimination) is present, though could be made more explicit. The connection between premises and conclusion is clear.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good** - Most premises are explicit and the conclusion follows logically, but the normative premise could be made more explicit.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nKey sentences showing understanding:\n- \"TwTwo widely discussed definitions of fairness in hiring algorithms are equalized odds and predictive parity. Equalized odds ensures that false positive and false negative rates are equal across demographic groups, preventing one group from being disproportionately rejected or falsely accepted. Predictive parity ensures that once a candidate is selected, their probability of being \"successful\" at the job is the same across groups.\"\n- \"Beigang critiques fairness metrics for their tendency to flatten historical context, arguing that fairness should not just be about balancing error rates but also about understanding the causal impact of sensitive attributes like race or gender.\"\n- \"Beigang warns that fairness metrics often overgenerate unfairness, meaning they sometimes flag disparities that aren't necessarily meaningful.\"\n\nThe essay demonstrates good understanding of the fairness metrics discussed (equalized odds and predictive parity) and accurately summarizes Beigang's (2023) critique of fairness metrics. The student explains these concepts in their own words rather than relying on direct quotes. The student also applies these concepts to the specific context of hiring algorithms.\n\nHowever, there are some potential issues. The essay repeatedly references Beigang (2023) but doesn't provide full context about this source. It's unclear what type of publication this is or what Beigang's full argument entails. Additionally, the essay contains several typographical errors (like \"difffferent\", \"suffffers\", \"TwTwo\") that suggest either careless proofreading or technical issues with the submission.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good** - Generally accurate summaries in the student's own words, though more context about Beigang's work would strengthen the essay.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nStructure analysis:\n- The essay has a clear introduction, several body sections that develop different aspects of the argument, and a conclusion.\n- The body is organized into sections that address: what fairness means, why equalized odds is better, limitations of equalized odds, and reframing the problem.\n- Each section builds on the previous one to develop the overall argument.\n\nKey analytical sentences:\n- \"TaTake a hiring model trained on historical data from a tech company where only 20% of past hires were women due to implicit bias. If the model is optimized for predictive parity, y, it will base its fairness calculations on past success rates, which are already skewed.\"\n- \"One question that keeps coming up is what we actually mean by 'fair hiring.' The company is optimizing for 'successful and happy employees', but those are weirdly subjective metrics to bake into an algorithm.\"\n- \"Equalized odds is the best fairness metric available for hiring models, but no statistical approach alone can make hiring truly fair.\"\n\nThe essay breaks down the problem into appropriate parts: defining fairness, comparing metrics, addressing limitations, and reframing the broader problem. It focuses analysis on key points rather than trying to cover too much. The essay uses examples to illustrate points (like the tech company example). The analysis goes beyond just comparing metrics to question the underlying assumptions about what constitutes successful hiring.\n\nThere are some clarity issues with occasional typographical errors (like \"TaTake\", extra commas after \"y\") that impede readability. The essay could also benefit from more detailed analysis of specific scenarios or case studies to strengthen its claims.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good** - Reasonable breakdown of the problem with focused analysis, though some parts could be developed more thoroughly.\n\n## Main Argument:\nThe essay's main argument is that equalized odds is a superior fairness metric for hiring algorithms compared to predictive parity because it reduces discriminatory hiring patterns rather than reinforcing them, better preserves historical context, and aligns more closely with legal and ethical hiring standards.\n\n## Supporting Points:\n1. Predictive parity assumes past hiring data is fair, which it often isn't, thus potentially reinforcing historical biases in hiring.\n2. Equalized odds ensures groups have similar false positive/negative rates, which prevents disproportionate filtering of marginalized candidates.\n3. Equalized odds preserves historical nuance by ensuring fair consideration rather than manipulating outcomes.\n4. Equalized odds better aligns with anti-discrimination laws and ethical standards.\n5. No fairness metric alone can solve systemic bias in hiring; companies must constantly evaluate and test their models with diverse stakeholder input.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments:\n\nThe student makes a valid argument for why equalized odds is better than predictive parity in hiring contexts. The explanation of how predictive parity can reinforce historical biases is logical and well-supported. The essay correctly identifies that if past hiring data reflects bias, then using that data to train algorithms without adjustment will perpetuate the bias.\n\nThe essay also points out limitations of equalized odds, which shows critical thinking. However, it could provide more specific details about how to implement equalized odds in practice or potential trade-offs between different fairness metrics. The essay briefly mentions the need for testing and stakeholder input but doesn't elaborate much on this process.\n\nThe argument about alignment with legal standards could be stronger with specific citations to relevant laws or regulations. This claim is made but not fully substantiated.\n\nThe essay's conclusion that \"fairness is a process, not a static rule\" is insightful and demonstrates understanding of the broader context of algorithmic fairness beyond technical solutions.\n\n## Assessment of Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus:\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear and logical structure with an introduction, body sections that develop different aspects of the argument, and a conclusion. The organization helps the reader follow the argument.\n\nLanguage: The language is generally clear and appropriate for an academic essay, though there are several typographical errors that suggest careless proofreading or submission issues.\n\nExamples: The essay uses examples to illustrate points, such as the tech company example to show how predictive parity can reinforce bias. However, more detailed case studies or concrete examples would strengthen the argument.\n\nFocus: The essay maintains focus on the question of which fairness metric is better for hiring algorithms and why. It doesn't wander into unrelated topics.\n\n## How Well the Essay Addresses the Assigned Question:\n\nThe essay directly addresses the question of which fairness definition a company should adopt for its hiring algorithms. It takes a clear position (equalized odds) and provides reasons for this choice while acknowledging limitations. The essay also goes beyond a simple comparison to consider broader questions about what fairness means in hiring contexts.\n\nOverall, the essay demonstrates good understanding of fairness metrics in hiring algorithms and makes a persuasive case for equalized odds over predictive parity. The argument is generally well-structured and focused, though it could benefit from more detailed examples, fewer typographical errors, and stronger substantiation of some claims."

         "I'll analyze this essay based on the provided rubric and guidelines.\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nLet me first identify the thesis statement in the essay.\n\nKey sentences related to thesis:\n- \"Data science objects are proposed as a tool for objective unbiased decision making, but often just replicate past biases.\"\n- \"Instead of helping us move forward into an unbiased society, they are taking us back to past biases, bounding us to the same rationales that dominated past thinking and shaped inequalities.\"\n- \"Just as physical infrastructure can anchor racial inequalities, like with the city planning designed to segregate communities, algorithms function as digital material anchors---entrenching past biases in modern decision-making.\"\n\nThe main thesis appears to be that data science products function as \"material anchors\" that perpetuate and sustain racism and inequality by replicating historical biases embedded in the data they use. The thesis directly addresses the question posed in the title.\n\nWhile the thesis is present in the introduction and elaborated throughout the essay, it could be more explicitly stated in a single, decisive sentence. The student implies but doesn't state directly in one sentence that \"yes, data science products do function as material anchors for racism.\"\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - Thesis is present but could be more explicitly and concisely stated in a single sentence.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nKey premises I can identify:\n1. Data science products rely on historical data that reflects past inequalities and biases.\n2. These products make predictions and decisions based on this biased data.\n3. Material anchors are objects that sustain and reinforce inequalities by becoming embedded in society.\n4. The continued use of these biased data science products perpetuates and reinforces systemic racism.\n\nConclusion: Data science products function as material anchors for racism by embedding historical biases into current decision-making systems.\n\nThe premises and their connection to the conclusion are generally well established. The student explains how historical data contains biases, how these biases get embedded in algorithms, and how these algorithms then function as material anchors that perpetuate racism.\n\nExamples provided:\n- Credit scoring algorithms using zip codes (proxy variables)\n- NYC infrastructure designed to keep minorities from certain areas\n- Healthcare algorithms that predict patient risk\n- Beauty AI that favors lighter skin tones\n- Facial recognition that fails on darker skin tones\n\nThe logical structure is sound, though there are some gaps in fully explaining how the concept of \"material anchors\" applies to data science products. The connection is made, but could be more robust.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - Most premises are explicit; the premises are connected to the conclusion, though the connection could be strengthened.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nThe essay demonstrates understanding of key concepts:\n\nKey sentences related to understanding:\n- \"Material Anchors refers to how physical objects, infrastructure, and in this case, algorithms sustain and reinforce inequalities. The concept is that these objects or algorithms become embedded into society, seeping into our minds, and shape biased actions into the world.\"\n- \"Systemic racism relates to structural or social racism, it is not at the individual scale nor is it cognitive. Structural racism is sustained in institutions and decisions over time, like anchoring bias, reinforcing the discrimination.\"\n\nThe student demonstrates a general understanding of the concepts of material anchors and systemic racism. The essay describes how these concepts apply to data science products. However, the essay could benefit from more direct references to course materials or scholarly sources to strengthen the understanding of these concepts. There are no direct quotations from texts, which makes it difficult to assess if the student is accurately representing course concepts.\n\nThe student applies the concept of material anchors to data science products in a reasonable way, but could provide more theoretical background on the concept itself.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - Generally accurate understanding with some limitations in depth; uses own words rather than quotes, but lacks explicit references to course texts.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nThe essay has a clear structure with distinct sections:\n- Introduction\n- Defining Data Science Products\n- Material Anchors\n- How Data Science Products Act as Material Anchors for Racism\n- Personal Stance\n\nThe analysis breaks down the problem into logical parts:\n1. What data science products are and how they work\n2. The concept of material anchors\n3. The connection between data science products and material anchors\n4. How this supports/perpetuates racism\n5. The student's own stance on the issue\n\nKey sentences related to analysis:\n- \"The data that the machines are learning on are biased, thus the bias is anchored in the model the machine is making and continues to shape decisions.\"\n- \"When AI predicts lighter skin toned people as beautiful and darker skin tones as less so, or when facial recognition fails on darker skin tones, the creators did not intentionally to my knowledge set out to discriminate against darker toned people. But, the data that the AI's were trained on used predominately white people, and anchored on the idea that white equates to beauty.\"\n\nThe essay provides several concrete examples to illustrate how data science products can function as material anchors for racism, which strengthens the analysis. The essay also considers the implications of this problem, including how it might perpetuate biases in society.\n\nHowever, the analysis could be more balanced. The student focuses primarily on how data science products can perpetuate racism but doesn't adequately explore potential counterarguments or nuances. For example, the essay doesn't consider how data science might be used to identify and correct biases or how the field is evolving to address these issues.\n\nThe clarity of the writing is generally good, though there are some sentences that could be more precise or concise. The language is accessible and the examples help clarify the points being made.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good - Reasonable breakdown of the problem; some parts analyzed more thoroughly than others; good use of examples.\n\n## Main Argument\n\nThe main argument of the essay is that data science products function as material anchors for racism by embedding historical biases in modern decision-making systems, thereby perpetuating and reinforcing systemic racism.\n\n## Supporting Points\n\n1. Data science products rely on historical data that reflects past social inequalities and biases.\n2. These products make predictions and classifications based on this biased data, which affects decisions like loan approvals, hiring, and healthcare allocation.\n3. When these algorithms are deployed, they function like material anchors, reinforcing existing inequalities even when there's no conscious intent to discriminate.\n4. Examples like predictive policing, credit scoring using zip codes, and healthcare risk assessment algorithms demonstrate how these products perpetuate racism.\n5. The use of proxy variables (like zip code for race) allows algorithms to perpetuate discrimination indirectly.\n\n## Critical Examination\n\nThe argument is generally valid, but there are some areas that could be strengthened:\n\n1. The essay assumes that all data science products necessarily perpetuate biases without adequately considering possible mitigating factors or examples of data science products designed to counteract bias.\n\n2. The explanation of \"material anchors\" could be more thorough. While the essay explains the concept in general terms and provides examples, a deeper theoretical understanding would strengthen the connection to data science products.\n\n3. The student makes a strong claim in their personal stance section that \"There is no using better data to train it on, because that world doesn't exist,\" which seems overly deterministic and ignores potential methods for creating more equitable data sets or correcting for known biases.\n\n4. The essay could more explicitly address the question of intentionality vs. outcome. It touches on this when discussing how creators don't intentionally discriminate, but this important distinction could be more fully developed.\n\nDespite these limitations, the argument is coherent and supported with relevant examples.\n\n## Assessment of Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear, logical structure that helps develop the argument systematically. Each section builds on the previous one, and the personal stance comes after the main argument has been presented.\n\nLanguage: The language is generally clear and accessible, though there are occasional unclear sentences or phrases. Technical terms like \"proxy variable\" are appropriately explained.\n\nExamples: The essay uses various examples effectively to illustrate its points, including loan approval algorithms, NYC infrastructure design, healthcare algorithms, and beauty/facial recognition AI. These examples help make abstract concepts more concrete.\n\nFocus: The essay stays focused on answering the question about whether data science products can be material anchors for racism. The examples and analysis are relevant to this question.\n\n## Addressing the Assigned Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the assigned question: \"Can data science products be 'material anchors' that support racism?\" The student clearly argues that yes, they can be, and explains how this happens through the perpetuation of historical biases embedded in the data. The essay defines both \"data science products\" and \"material anchors,\" and explains how these concepts connect to racism.\n\nThe essay could explore more deeply what makes something specifically a \"material anchor\" rather than just a mechanism for perpetuating bias, but it does engage with the core of the question.\n\n## Word Count Assessment\n\nThe essay appears to be within the 1500-word limit. It's comprehensive enough to cover the main points without being overly verbose.\n\n## Overall Preliminary Assessment\n\nThis is a solid essay that directly addresses the question posed. It has a clear thesis, a logical argument structure, demonstrates understanding of key concepts, and uses examples effectively to illustrate points. \n\nThe main areas for improvement would be:\n1. More explicit statement of the thesis in a single, decisive sentence\n2. Deeper engagement with the theoretical concept of \"material anchors\"\n3. More balanced analysis that considers potential counterarguments\n4. More direct references to course materials or scholarly sources\n\nBased on the rubric, the essay seems to fall mainly in the \"Good\" category across the criteria, with some elements approaching \"Excellent\" (particularly in the use of examples) and some elements \"Needs Improvement\" (particularly in the depth of engagement with course concepts)."

         "Let me analyze this student essay using the provided rubric and general essay guidelines.\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nThe main thesis of the essay seems to be contained in this paragraph:\n\n> \"Within this essay we will explore how data science products were once utilitarian models; they serve as material anchors in the postmodern landscape that perpetuate systems of oppression through the creation, maintenance, and augmentation of power.\"\n\nThe thesis is also reinforced in the conclusion:\n\n> \"While Data Science Products can be seen as material anchors that support racism and other systems of oppression that engage with socially embedded postmodern frameworks within our landscape, we must begin to push back on the majoritarian narratives that perpetuate systemic inequality within our country.\"\n\nThe thesis answers the question of whether data science products can be material anchors that support racism, arguing that yes, they can and do serve as material anchors that perpetuate systems of oppression including racism.\n\nAssessment: The thesis is clearly stated and takes a decisive position on the question, arguing that data science products do function as material anchors that support racism. This meets the \"Excellent\" criterion for thesis.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nThe main premises of the argument appear to be:\n\n1. Material anchors are \"devices used to stabilize a structure\" (defined by the student).\n2. Data science models can stabilize or uphold systems of oppression.\n3. Postmodernism critiques how power is maintained and augmented through innovation.\n4. Data science products/AI models perpetuate biases (shown through case studies).\n5. These biases disproportionately affect marginalized groups.\n6. Even with efforts to correct them, the status quo power structures have incentives to maintain these systems.\n\nThe conclusion follows that data science products are material anchors that support racism and other systems of oppression.\n\nKey normative premises:\n> \"The maintenance of unequal structures means the maintenance of power for a majority group, and dismantling this system means dismantling the status quo, which the powerful who are lucky to grasp onto it will never do.\"\n\nThe student provides case studies (St. George's Hospital Medical School and COMPAS) to support the argument that data science products perpetuate biases.\n\nHowever, there are some logical issues in the essay:\n- The connection between postmodernism and the case studies isn't fully developed.\n- Some statements like \"would people want to?\" assume motives without sufficient evidence.\n- The leap from \"AI models have biases\" to \"they are material anchors of oppression\" could be more explicitly connected.\n\nAssessment: The essay presents most premises explicitly and connects them to the conclusion. The key normative premise about power maintenance is present. However, some connections between premises are not fully developed, and there are some assumptions that could be better supported. This falls between \"Good\" and \"Excellent\" for argument validity, but is closer to \"Good\" due to these gaps.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nThe essay references Jean-François Lyotard's postmodernism:\n> \"Jean-Francios Lyotard, who is regarded as the first philosopher to use the term 'Postmodernism' said in his book The Postmodern Condition 'In the discourse of today's financial backers of research, the only credible goal is power. Scientists, technicians, and instruments are purchased not to find truth, but to augment power.' (Lyotard, 1984)\"\n\nThe student also references case studies:\n- St. George's Hospital Medical School's AI screening model (from Gabrielle Johnson's work)\n- COMPAS recidivism prediction system\n\nThe essay demonstrates understanding of these cases, though there are some simplifications. The student accurately summarizes how these systems perpetuated biases based on historical data.\n\nThe student also shows understanding of Northpointe's theoretical foundations for COMPAS, including Social Strain theory and Control/Restraint theory.\n\nHowever, the essay contains repeated typographical errors (e.g., \"LyLyotard,\" \"difffferent,\" \"affffluent\") which suggests some carelessness. Some concepts like \"material anchors\" are given a definition by the student rather than citing an established definition.\n\nAssessment: The essay demonstrates good understanding of the referenced texts and cases, summarizing them largely in the student's own words. There are no major misinterpretations, though some theoretical connections could be more nuanced. This meets the \"Good\" criterion for understanding.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nThe essay has a generally clear structure:\n- Introduction and thesis\n- Definition of key terms (material anchors, postmodernism)\n- Case study 1: St. George's Hospital\n- Case study 2: COMPAS\n- Analysis of systemic issues beyond the models themselves\n- Connection back to postmodernism and conclusion\n\nThe breakdown of the problem is reasonable, focusing on:\n1. How data science models can contain biases\n2. How these biases affect marginalized groups\n3. How the persistence of these biases relates to power structures\n\nThe student provides detailed analysis of the COMPAS case study, examining its theoretical foundations and implications.\n\nHowever, the essay has several issues with clarity:\n- Numerous typographical errors and repeated words (e.g., \"WiWithin,\" \"y,\", \"w,\")\n- Some run-on sentences and awkward phrasing\n- The analysis of the St. George's Hospital case is much briefer than the COMPAS analysis\n- The connection back to the concept of \"material anchors\" could be more explicit throughout\n\nAssessment: The essay breaks down the problem into suitable parts and provides appropriate detail, especially for the COMPAS case. However, the analysis is somewhat imbalanced, and clarity issues affect the overall quality. This meets the \"Good\" criterion for analysis, structure, and clarity, but has some elements of \"Needs Improvement\" due to clarity issues.\n\n## Main Argument\n\nThe main argument of the essay is that data science products function as material anchors that support racism and other systems of oppression by perpetuating historical biases and power structures. The essay argues that AI models, trained on historically biased data, reproduce and amplify these biases, disproportionately harming marginalized groups.\n\n## Supporting Points\n\n1. Data science models like St. George's Hospital's admission system and COMPAS reproduce historical biases in their outputs.\n2. These biases disproportionately affect marginalized groups, especially racial minorities.\n3. The theoretical foundations of these models (e.g., Social Strain theory) themselves contain assumptions that disadvantage marginalized groups.\n4. Power structures have incentives to maintain these biases rather than correct them.\n5. Through a postmodern lens, technology serves to augment power rather than find truth, making these biases systemic rather than accidental.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\n1. The student's argument that data science products are \"material anchors\" is based on their own definition of material anchors as \"devices used to stabilize a structure.\" This definition seems crafted to fit their thesis rather than being an established concept in philosophy.\n\n2. The connection to postmodernism is somewhat superficial. The student cites Lyotard once but doesn't fully engage with postmodern theory throughout the analysis.\n\n3. The argument about power structures having incentives to maintain biases makes assumptions about intentions without sufficient evidence. The statement \"which the powerful who are lucky to grasp onto it will never do\" is an unsupported generalization.\n\n4. The analysis of COMPAS is detailed and provides good evidence for how algorithms can perpetuate biases, though the student sometimes conflates correlation and causation.\n\n5. The essay does not adequately address potential counterarguments, such as the possibility that data science could be used to identify and correct biases.\n\n## Essay's Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a logical flow from introduction to conclusion, though the balance between sections is uneven.\n\nLanguage: The essay contains numerous typographical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from its clarity. Examples include repeated words like \"WiWithin\" and unnecessary commas followed by spaces.\n\nExamples: The essay uses two strong case studies (St. George's Hospital and COMPAS) to illustrate its points, though the first case is underdeveloped compared to the second.\n\nFocus: The essay maintains focus on the question of whether data science products can be material anchors supporting racism. However, it sometimes drifts into broader discussions of power without tying them back to the central thesis.\n\n## How Well the Essay Addresses the Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the question of whether data science products can be material anchors that support racism. It takes a clear position (yes, they can and do) and provides evidence through case studies to support this claim. The essay could more consistently refer back to the concept of \"material anchors\" throughout, as this term sometimes gets lost in the broader discussion of bias and power.\n\nOverall, the essay does answer the assigned question, though there are issues with clarity, balance, and the depth of engagement with philosophical concepts."

         "Let me start by analyzing this student's essay about data-driven tools for recidivism risk assessment according to the rubric criteria.\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nLet's identify the thesis statement:\n\n> \"I argue that while advocates fofor recidivism risk assessment tools claim them to be objbjective and neutral predictors, in reality, y, these tools oftften encode human bias and perprpetutuate or even amplify fy inequalities; these models do not reflflect objbjective reality, y, but instead reflflect historic inequities and flflawed data.\"\n\nThis is a clear thesis statement that directly answers the prompt question about whether recidivism risk assessment tools are objective. The student takes a clear position that these tools are not objective because they encode human bias and perpetuate inequalities. The thesis is decisive and specific about why these tools fail to be objective.\n\nPreliminary assessment for Thesis: **Excellent**. The thesis clearly states the student's position and directly answers the question posed.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nThe main argument structure appears to be:\n\nPremise 1: Recidivism risk assessment tools are trained on flawed and incomplete data.\nPremise 2: These tools incorporate questions that serve as proxies for protected characteristics like race and socioeconomic status.\nPremise 3: The data these tools use reflects historical biases in policing and the criminal justice system.\nConclusion: Therefore, recidivism risk assessment tools are not objective but instead perpetuate existing biases and inequalities.\n\nKey quotes for analysis:\n\n> \"Though as Ludwig and Mullainathan emphasize, an algorithm's recommendation can only be as accurate as the data it is trained on. In reality, y, data is flflawed or incomplete in some way in nearly every ry apapplication, guaranteeing some level of errrror.\"\n\n> \"Though LSI-R does not explicitly ask illegal questions regarding race, the data collected frfrom the survey includes enough proxy infoformation that race is essentially included despite not being explicitly stated.\"\n\n> \"Law enfoforcement may disproportionately criminalize poorer individuduals based on the neighborhrhoods they police. This foforms a positive fefeedbdback loop as offffificers detect crime in marginalized neighborhrhoods, increase police presence, and therefofore detect more crime.\"\n\nThe premises are explicitly stated and logically connected to the conclusion. The student outlines how the data used in these algorithms reflects biases in policing, how questions in risk assessment tools act as proxies for protected characteristics, and how these factors lead to perpetuating inequalities. The conclusion logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe student acknowledges counterarguments:\n> \"Advocates fofor recidivism risk models suggest that they are not inherently biased, and I generally agree with this statement.\"\n\nBut then explains why this doesn't save the objectivity claim:\n> \"However, even a fafair algorithm's interactions with flflawed data will produduce flflawed results.\"\n\nPreliminary assessment for Argument Validity: **Excellent** to **Good**. Most premises are explicit and the conclusion follows logically. The student acknowledges counterarguments but maintains their position with sound reasoning.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nThe student references and summarizes several key texts:\n\n1. Ludwig and Mullainathan's \"Fragile Algorithms and Fallible Decision Makers\"\n> \"Ludwig and Mullainathan, in their article FrFragile Alglgoriththms and FaFallible DecisisionMaMakekersrs, show that these algorithms, while achieving their goal of consistency, y, did not achieve the desired accuracy rates.\"\n\n2. Cathy O'Neil's \"Weapons of Math Destruction\"\n> \"Cathy O'Neil details the ways in which algorithms tend to positively cater to already-privileged individuduals while exacerbrbating discrimination and prejejudice among minorities and disadvantaged groupups in her text, WeWeapapons of of MaMath th Destruction.\"\n\nThe student demonstrates understanding of the LSI-R assessment tool and its questionnaire format, as well as issues of bias in policing and criminal justice data.\n\nThe student summarizes the texts in their own words rather than relying heavily on direct quotes. They integrate the ideas from these sources into their own argument.\n\nPreliminary assessment for Understanding: **Good** to **Excellent**. The student accurately summarizes referenced texts in their own words, though there could be more depth in explaining concepts from the texts.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nStructure:\nThe essay is well-structured with an introduction, development of the argument, and conclusion. It includes section headings (\"Self-Fulfilling Prophecies,\" \"Designed Discrimination,\" and \"Conclusion\") which help organize the content.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe student breaks down the problem into suitable parts:\n1. The claim of objectivity in recidivism risk assessment tools\n2. How these tools work and their limitations\n3. How these tools encode bias through data and questionnaires\n4. The cycle of bias reinforcement through policing patterns\n5. Potential future improvements and ethical considerations\n\nSome relevant quotes showing analytical thinking:\n> \"There is an imbalance in policing of rich versus poorer neighborhrhoods and a statistical inequality in the individuduals police choose to stop fofor questioning\"\n\n> \"Though they may have similar propensity fofor reoffffefending in reality, y, the richer defefendant who may have had more positive experiences or no experiences with law enfoforcement would be characterized totally diffffeferently by LSI-R.\"\n\nThe student provides appropriate detail in analyzing how the risk assessment tools can perpetuate bias, particularly in their discussion of the LSI-R questionnaire.\n\nClarity:\nThere appear to be some typographical issues throughout the essay with duplicated letters and spacing issues (e.g., \"fofor\" instead of \"for\", \"objbjective\" instead of \"objective\"), which somewhat impair readability.\n\nPreliminary assessment for Analysis, Structure, and Clarity: **Good**. The essay demonstrates a reasonable breakdown of the problem and focused analysis, though some parts are analyzed more thoroughly than others. The clarity is somewhat impaired by typographical issues.\n\n## Main Argument and Supporting Points\n\nMain argument: Recidivism risk assessment tools are not objective because they encode human biases, perpetuate inequalities, and reflect historical inequities and flawed data.\n\nSupporting points:\n1. Machine learning algorithms can only be as accurate and unbiased as the data they are trained on, which in the criminal justice context is flawed and incomplete.\n2. Tools like LSI-R include questions that serve as proxies for protected characteristics like race and socioeconomic status.\n3. Policing patterns create a feedback loop where marginalized communities are over-policed, leading to more arrests and higher risk scores for individuals from these communities.\n4. Even well-designed algorithms learn and reproduce biases present in the data they are trained on.\n5. Current implementation of these tools in the criminal justice system perpetuates cycles of inequality rather than breaking them.\n\n## Critical Examination of Argument Validity\n\nThe student's main argument is valid and logically sound. They establish that:\n1. Objectivity requires freedom from bias\n2. Risk assessment tools incorporate biased data and methodologies\n3. Therefore, these tools are not objective\n\nThe student correctly identifies the circular reasoning in how these tools perpetuate inequality: marginalized neighborhoods are over-policed, leading to more arrests, which creates data showing higher crime rates, which then justifies more policing, and so on.\n\nThe student acknowledges counterarguments and provides nuanced analysis, recognizing that the algorithms themselves may not be inherently biased but become biased through interaction with flawed data.\n\nOne potential weakness is that the student could have more thoroughly examined what \"objectivity\" means in this context. Is it purely about the absence of bias, or are there other aspects of objectivity that should be considered?\n\n## Assessment of Essay Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The section headings help organize the content, though the transitions between sections could be smoother.\n\nLanguage: The language is generally clear and appropriate for an academic essay, despite the typographical issues. The student uses discipline-specific terminology correctly.\n\nExamples: The student provides specific examples, particularly in discussing the LSI-R questionnaire and how it might differentially impact defendants from different backgrounds. However, more concrete examples or case studies could strengthen the argument.\n\nFocus: The essay maintains a clear focus on the question of objectivity in recidivism risk assessment tools. It doesn't drift into tangential topics and remains centered on the thesis.\n\n## How Well the Essay Addresses the Assigned Question\n\nThe assigned question asks: \"Data-driven tools for recidivism risk assessment operationalize recidivism as 'a new arrest within two years.' Proponents of such tools claim that such risk assessment tools are objective. Are they?\"\n\nThe essay directly addresses this question. It acknowledges the proponents' claim of objectivity and then systematically argues against this claim by showing how these tools encode bias and perpetuate inequalities. The student not only answers the question with a clear \"no\" but also explains why these tools fail to be objective and what would be required for them to approach objectivity.\n\nThe student also addresses the operationalization of recidivism as \"a new arrest within two years\" by discussing how arrest patterns reflect biases in policing rather than objective measures of criminal behavior."

         "Thesis: The essay presents a clear and decisive thesis that directly answers the question. The student states early in the essay: \"This final recommendation will be to apply the definition of separation, which requires equal false and true positive rates across groups. This definition allows for a balance to be attained where a company can focus on diverse hiring practices, while still ensuring that each new employee hired will have the optimal probability to continue on successfully in the company.\"\n\nThe thesis is well-developed throughout the essay and effectively restated in the conclusion: \"As a result, I recommended that the separation definition be used when creating this machine learning system. This definition allowed for a balance between diverse hiring practices, and recruiting the most effective, successful team possible.\"",
         "Argument Validity: The argument has most premises explicitly stated, with a logical flow from premises to conclusion. The student presents a structured case examining each fairness definition:\n\nFor independence: \"It is unrealistic to think that base rates for employee success are the same across groups... the company's main interest is hiring a successful, efficient workforce, which is not prioritized here.\"\n\nFor sufficiency: \"While this definition seems to be a stronger option than independence...I opted against it for the potential to limit perspectives and representation from marginalized groups.\"\n\nFor separation (the recommended option): \"This model combats historical bias and lasting discrimination by ensuring that the rate of people who are wrongfully turned down from the job or wrongfully called for an interview are the same across groups.\"\n\nWhile the normative premise about why the appropriate balance between diversity and efficiency matters could be more explicit, and more concrete examples would strengthen the argument, the overall structure is valid and the conclusion follows logically from the premises.",
         "Understanding: The student demonstrates excellent understanding of the three fairness definitions from Barocas' \"Fairness and Machine Learning.\" They accurately describe independence as \"ensuring equal hiring rates across different protected groups,\" sufficiency as creating a scoring system where \"a specific score denotes the same possibility of success or failure for an individual, regardless of the protected group,\" and separation as ensuring \"that there will be equal rates between the false positive rate (FPR) and the false negative rate (FNR).\"\n\nEach concept is explained in the student's own words without misinterpretations, and correctly applied to the specific context of resume screening. The student shows nuanced understanding of how these definitions operate and their respective trade-offs in practice.",
         "Analysis, Structure, and Clarity: The essay has a clear structure that effectively breaks down the problem. The introduction outlines the approach: \"In the course of this essay, I will evaluate each definition for its pros and cons in this scenario, before settling on my ultimate recommendation.\" \n\nEach definition is systematically analyzed with a balanced assessment of advantages and disadvantages. The student demonstrates critical thinking by acknowledging limitations of their recommended approach: \"This isn't to say that this is perfect for building a machine learning system - this definition is rather data-intensive.\"\n\nThe analysis is focused and the organization is logical, though it could benefit from more concrete examples to illustrate abstract concepts. There are some typographical issues (repeated \"y,\" inconsistent spacing, \"sufffficiency\" spelling) that slightly affect clarity, but do not significantly detract from the overall quality of analysis.",

You've demonstrated an excellent understanding of the three definitions of fairness and provided a clear, well-reasoned argument for why separation is the most appropriate choice for this resume screening context. Your analysis of the trade-offs between diversity and hiring efficiency is thoughtful and your thesis is decisively stated and well-supported.\n\nFor future essays, consider incorporating specific examples or hypothetical scenarios that show how each fairness definition would play out in practice. This would make your already strong abstract reasoning more concrete and persuasive. Also, you might want to develop a bit more explicitly why the particular balance that separation strikes is ethically preferable - not just practically beneficial.

         "Let me analyze this essay according to the rubric criteria:\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nRelevant quotes:\n- \"This final recommendation will be to apply the definition of separation, which requires equal false and true positive rates across groups. This definition allows for a balance to be attained where a company can focus on diverse hiring practices, while still ensuring that each new employee hired will have the optimal probability to continue on successfully in the company.\"\n- \"As a result, I recommended that the separation definition be used when creating this machine learning system. This definition allowed for a balance between diverse hiring practices, and recruiting the most effffective, successful team possible.\"\n\nThe essay clearly states its thesis that \"separation\" is the most appropriate definition of fairness for the company to use in its ML-based resume screening system. The thesis is decisive and answers the question directly. The student articulates the reasoning behind this choice and contrasts it with alternative definitions of fairness.\n\nAssessment: Excellent - The thesis is clearly stated, answers the question decisively, and appears early in the essay.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nRelevant quotes:\n- \"For a company that seeks to optimize its résumé screening process and use machine learning to predict a potential employee's success, fairness is key to address in creating this machine learning system. It will be important to balance the idea that separate groups should have equalized odds in the system, so as to avoid claims of discrimination, with the concept of predictive parity, as we want our system to accurately predict the potential employee's success.\"\n- \"While independence can have too strong of a hand in undoing historical bias, and sufffficiency has the legitimate possibility of perpetuating it, this definition strikes a perfect balance. To put it simply, this model combats historical bias and lasting discrimination by ensuring that the rate of people who are wrongfully turned down from the job or wrongfully called for an interview are the same across groups.\"\n- \"If no group is disproportionately rejected or accepted at a higher rate, then the hiring system is at equilibrium, shielding the company from accusations of disparate impact and ensuring that applicants are thoughtfully evaluated, ideally resulting in a low false negative rate which is equalized across groups.\"\n\nThe student presents a valid argument that has the following structure:\n1. Premise: A fairness definition should balance diversity with hiring efficiency\n2. Premise: Independence \"overcorrects\" and doesn't account for different base rates\n3. Premise: Sufficiency does nothing to correct historical bias\n4. Premise: Separation balances diversity with efficiency by ensuring equal error rates\n5. Conclusion: Separation is the best definition of fairness for this context\n\nThe student explicitly discusses their premises and shows how they lead to the conclusion. They adequately connect their premises to their conclusion, explaining why each definition of fairness would or wouldn't work well for the company's needs.\n\nOne possible weakness is that the student could have been more explicit about the normative premise regarding the appropriate balance between diversity and efficiency. Additionally, they could have more clearly articulated why having equal error rates across groups is ethically preferable in this specific context.\n\nAssessment: Good - Most premises are explicit, and the conclusion follows logically from the premises. The connection between premises and conclusion is clear, though a more explicit normative premise about the relative importance of diversity versus efficiency would strengthen the argument.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nRelevant quotes:\n- \"These distinct definitions of fairness have been termed 1) independence, 2) separation, and 3) sufffficiency. In the course of this essay, I will evaluate each definition for its pros and cons in this scenario, before settling on my ultimate recommendation.\"\n- \"First, I will discuss independence, which in my opinion is the most 'brute force' option, sometimes viewed as a quota. This definition of fairness is given as ensuring equal hiring rates across difffferent protected groups, done by making the protected characteristic 'independent' of the data used by the machine to generate a prediction.\"\n- \"Finally, I will speak on the definition of fairness known as separation. In action, this definition seeks to ensure that there will be equal rates between the false positive rate (FPR) and the false negative rate (FNR).\"\n\nThe student accurately summarizes the three fairness definitions from Barocas' \"Fairness and Machine Learning\" in their own words. They correctly identify independence as requiring equal hiring rates across groups, sufficiency as equalizing risk scores across groups, and separation as equalizing error rates across groups.\n\nThere appear to be no significant misinterpretations of the source material. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the concepts and applies them appropriately to the scenario.\n\nAssessment: Excellent - Referenced texts are accurately summarized in the student's own words with no apparent misinterpretations.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nRelevant quotes:\n- \"In the course of this essay, I will evaluate each definition for its pros and cons in this scenario, before settling on my ultimate recommendation.\"\n- \"Where independence can have too strong of a hand in undoing historical bias, and sufffficiency has the legitimate possibility of perpetuating it, this definition strikes a perfect balance.\"\n- \"This isn't to say that this is perfect for building a machine learning system - this definition is rather data-intensive, as one must keep careful track of the various rates, monitoring individuals for their success, in order to create a continuously successful system.\"\n\nThe essay has a clear structure, breaking down the problem into suitable parts by discussing each definition of fairness separately before making a recommendation. The student provides an appropriate level of detail for each definition, discussing both its advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThe analysis is focused and logical, comparing the three definitions based on how well they balance diversity with efficiency. The student demonstrates critical thinking by acknowledging that their recommended approach (separation) also has disadvantages, such as being data-intensive.\n\nThere are some typographical issues and inconsistencies in the essay (such as the repeated use of \"y,\" and inconsistent spacing after periods), but these do not significantly detract from the clarity of the analysis.\n\nAssessment: Good to Excellent - The problem is broken down into suitable parts with an appropriate level of detail. The analysis is focused and logical, though there are some minor clarity issues due to typographical errors.\n\n## Main Argument\n\nThe main argument of the essay is that separation is the most appropriate definition of fairness for a company using machine learning to screen resumes because it strikes the best balance between promoting diversity and ensuring employee success. The student argues that separation, which requires equal error rates across protected groups, avoids both the over-correction problem of independence (which may lead to hiring less qualified candidates to achieve demographic parity) and the potential to perpetuate bias that comes with sufficiency (which does nothing to address historical discrimination).\n\n## Supporting Points\n\n1. Independence is too \"brute force\" and fails to account for different base rates of success across groups, potentially leading to hiring less qualified candidates.\n2. Sufficiency provides objective individual risk scores but does nothing to combat historical bias, potentially perpetuating underrepresentation of marginalized groups.\n3. Separation balances diversity and efficiency by ensuring that no group is disproportionately rejected or accepted.\n4. Separation protects the company from accusations of disparate impact while still prioritizing hiring qualified candidates.\n5. While separation requires more data and monitoring, this trade-off is worth it for achieving a balanced and fair hiring process.\n\n## Critical Examination\n\nThe student's argument is generally valid and logically consistent. They carefully consider the pros and cons of each definition of fairness and make a reasonable case for why separation is the most appropriate in this context.\n\nOne weakness is that the student could have more explicitly discussed the trade-offs between the company's different goals (diversity, efficiency, legal protection) and why the balance struck by separation is the most ethically appropriate. They mention these trade-offs but could have provided a more thorough normative analysis.\n\nAnother potential weakness is that the student could have provided more concrete examples or scenarios to illustrate how each definition would play out in practice. This would have made their abstract claims more concrete and persuasive.\n\n## Assessment of Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear and logical structure, with an introduction that outlines the approach, separate sections for each definition of fairness, and a conclusion that reinforces the main argument.\n\nLanguage: The language is generally clear and appropriate, though there are some typographical issues (like the repeated \"y\" and inconsistent spacing) that somewhat detract from the clarity.\n\nExamples: The essay could benefit from more concrete examples to illustrate the abstract concepts. While the student explains the definitions clearly, providing specific scenarios would make the arguments more persuasive.\n\nFocus: The essay maintains a good focus on the specific question of which definition of fairness the company should adopt. It avoids unnecessary tangents and consistently relates the discussion back to the central question.\n\n## How Well the Essay Addresses the Assigned Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the assigned question, which asks what definition of fairness a company should adopt for its ML-based resume screening system. The student clearly states their recommendation (separation) and provides a reasoned justification for this choice by comparing it to alternative definitions.\n\nThe essay is responsive to the specific context mentioned in the question (a company using ML to screen resumes) and considers relevant factors such as the need to balance diversity with hiring efficiency. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of fairness in machine learning and applies it appropriately to the given scenario.\n\nOverall, the essay effectively addresses the assigned question, providing a clear recommendation supported by reasoned analysis."

         "**Argument Validity**\n\nThe essay presents several premises:\n- \"Products that require limited and low data entries run with only so much purview and power.

For example, when discussing cameras: \"The technology to accurately sense shading/darkness or people with brown/black skin may need to be improved,\" the essay doesn't explore why such improvements haven't been made or what that implies about the systems that produce these technologies.\n\nThe clarity of writing is inconsistent, with some awkward phrasing and grammatical errors that make it difficult to follow the argument at times.",

         "## 1. Thesis\nLet me identify the thesis of this essay. Here are some key sentences that seem to express the author's main argument:\n\n\"For this essay, overall use of motion sensors and cameras and how the limited 'thinking' they are allowed, while making some people uncomfortable, is a constraint of technology and projection of larger issues rather than an act of mechanized racism.\"\n\n\"These limited thought, 'dumb' data science products often fall under misuse or insufficient data but to say these material anchors support racism is far from fact.\"\n\nThe thesis appears to be that certain data science products like motion sensors and cameras that have been criticized as racist are not actually supporting racism, but rather have technological limitations and that people may be projecting their experiences of racism onto these devices.\n\nAssessment: The thesis is present and takes a clear position, though it could be more explicitly stated. The wording of the first sentence quoted above is somewhat awkward and could be clearer. It does answer the question posed in the title, arguing that these data science products are not \"material anchors\" supporting racism. \n\nPreliminary Assessment: Good\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nLet's analyze the premises and how they connect to the conclusion:\n\nPremise 1: \"Products that require limited and low data entries run with only so much purview and power. They are not making racist decisions on the spot each time they are operated in a new scenario simply because they lack the ability to do so.\"\n\nPremise 2: \"Most sensor products fill the role of a very basic function – has X changed in relation to Y... If for any reason the sensor cannot reflect, then it cannot function. This can be due to one not positioning themselves correctly to cause the reflection (operator error) or because the sensor itself is not strong enough to be reflected and instead becomes absorbed by what is presented in front of it.\"\n\nPremise 3: \"Cameras are... based on limited data that correspond to certain preprogrammed checklists or scenarios... They are not built like an AI that can continue to learn and differentiate people or settings the more photos get taken.\"\n\nPremise 4: \"The technology to accurately sense shading/darkness or people with brown/black skin may need to be improved.\"\n\nConclusion: \"These limited thought, 'dumb' data science products often fall under misuse or insufficient data but to say these material anchors support racism is far from fact.\"\n\nThe premises are generally stated, though not always explicitly identified as premises of an argument. The conclusion does follow somewhat from the premises, as the author argues that these devices have technological limitations rather than racist intent. However, there is a missing normative premise about what constitutes \"supporting racism.\" The author seems to assume that without intent or agency on the part of the device, it cannot \"support racism,\" but this normative assumption isn't fully articulated or defended.\n\nThe connection between the premises and conclusion is somewhat clear, but there are logical gaps. For example, the author doesn't fully address the possibility that devices can support racism through their effects rather than through intent.\n\nPreliminary Assessment: Needs Improvement\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nLet's look at how the essay represents the views it discusses:\n\n\"As referenced by Liao and Huebner, a black man recorded, with a humorous perspective, a soap dispenser that did not dispense for him but did for his white friend. Also mentioned by them was another black person who found she affected by the camera and how brown skin came out on color film.\"\n\n\"Liao and Huebner think that any data science product that cause such feelings as mentioned above, ones that perpetuate behaviors, associations, or feelings with negativity due to psychological judgments, are rooting in racism and help reinforce racist norm in society.\"\n\nThe essay references Liao and Huebner's work and attempts to summarize some of their key points. However, the summary is quite brief and lacks detail. It mentions examples from their work but doesn't provide a thorough explanation of their arguments or theoretical framework. The statement that \"Liao and Huebner think that any data science product that cause such feelings... are rooting in racism\" is vague and potentially oversimplifies their position.\n\nThere are also some grammatical errors in these sections that might indicate a lack of careful reading, such as \"another black person who found she affected by the camera.\"\n\nThe essay doesn't misrepresent Liao and Huebner outright, but it doesn't demonstrate a deep understanding of their arguments either.\n\nPreliminary Assessment: Needs Improvement\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nStructure:\nThe essay is divided into sections with clear headings: \"The Culprits,\" \"Caught in the Act?,\" \"Err on the Side of Error,\" and \"Let's Recap.\" This provides a clear organizational structure.\n\nAnalysis:\n\"Data science products come in a large spectrum – those that run on the simplest or smallest of data to full continual learning AI algorithms.\"\n\n\"If the photos in the film were not coming out great, various other reasons might be of consequence that are not racially charged. The lighting might need to be improved, there is a plethora of changes one can make on the settings, or the technology to accurately sense shading/darkness or people with brown/black skin may need to be improved.\"\n\n\"Of course, one can claim that the inabilities, or failures, of the data in the product to function as perfectly as they do with any lighter skinned person can itself be racist.\"\n\nThe essay breaks down the problem into parts (different types of data science products, different explanations for their failures) and considers different perspectives. However, the analysis is somewhat superficial at times. For instance, the author mentions that technology \"may need to be improved\" for darker skin but doesn't explore the implications of this failure in depth or consider why such improvements haven't been made.\n\nThe essay also doesn't engage deeply with the concept of \"material anchors\" from the title. While it argues that these devices don't \"support racism,\" it doesn't fully analyze what it would mean for a device to be a \"material anchor\" or how this concept relates to racism.\n\nThe clarity of the writing is variable. There are some awkward sentences and grammatical errors that make it difficult to follow the author's argument at times.\n\nPreliminary Assessment: Needs Improvement\n\n## Main Argument and Supporting Points\n\nMain Argument: Data science products like motion sensors and cameras that have been criticized as racist are not actually supporting racism; rather, they have technological limitations, and people may be projecting their experiences of racism onto these devices.\n\nSupporting Points:\n1. Basic data science products like motion sensors and cameras have limited data and programming and cannot make \"racist decisions.\"\n2. Failures of these devices to work properly with darker skin can be explained by technological limitations or user error, not racism.\n3. While these limitations might cause negative feelings in users, attributing racist intent to the devices is projecting human qualities onto machines.\n4. There may be a need for technological improvement, but this does not mean the devices themselves are racist or support racism.\n5. The devices are \"nothing more than tools that have emotions, feelings, and labels thrusted onto them when they don't work accurately.\"\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\nThe essay's main argument has several weaknesses:\n\n1. False dichotomy: The author sets up a dichotomy between devices being racist (having racist intent) and having technological limitations. But these are not necessarily mutually exclusive. A device could have technological limitations that disproportionately affect certain racial groups, which could be considered a form of structural racism even without intent.\n\n2. Missing step in reasoning: The author argues that because devices lack agency or intent, they cannot be racist or support racism. But this assumes a definition of racism that requires intent, which is not universally accepted. The author needs to address theories of structural or systemic racism that don't require intent.\n\n3. Insufficient engagement with counterarguments: While the author does briefly acknowledge that \"one can claim that the inabilities, or failures, of the data in the product to function as perfectly as they do with any lighter skinned person can itself be racist,\" they don't fully engage with this counterargument or provide a strong rebuttal.\n\n4. Misunderstanding of the concept of \"material anchors\": The essay doesn't demonstrate a clear understanding of what Liao and Huebner mean by \"material anchors\" and how this concept relates to racism.\n\n## Assessment of Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear structure with distinct sections, but the flow of the argument within and between sections could be improved. Some transitions are abrupt, and the author sometimes introduces new ideas without fully developing earlier ones.\n\nLanguage: The language is generally clear but there are grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that sometimes obscure the meaning. For example: \"For this essay, overall use of motion sensors and cameras and how the limited 'thinking' they are allowed, while making some people uncomfortable, is a constraint of technology and projection of larger issues rather than an act of mechanized racism.\"\n\nExamples: The essay uses examples from Liao and Huebner's work, such as the soap dispenser and camera film issues. However, these examples are not described in detail, and the author doesn't provide any additional examples to support their arguments.\n\nFocus: The essay stays relatively focused on the question of whether data science products can be \"material anchors\" that support racism, though it doesn't fully engage with the concept of \"material anchors.\" The author narrows the focus to \"dumb\" automated devices rather than more advanced AI, which is a reasonable choice given the scope of the essay.\n\n## Address of the Assigned Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the question posed in the title: \"Can data science products be 'material anchors' that support racism?\" The author takes a clear position, arguing that these products do not support racism in the way that Liao and Huebner suggest.\n\nHowever, the depth of engagement with the question is limited by several factors:\n1. The essay doesn't fully explain or engage with the concept of \"material anchors.\"\n2. The author narrowly focuses on intent and agency, overlooking other ways in which devices might \"support racism.\"\n3. The engagement with the source material (Liao and Huebner) is relatively superficial.\n\nIn summary, while the essay addresses the assigned question, it doesn't do so with the depth or nuance that would be expected for a philosophy essay on this topic.\n\nWord Count: The essay seems to be within the 1500-word limit, though I haven't counted the exact number of words.\n\nOverall, this essay demonstrates some understanding of the topic and makes an attempt to construct an argument, but it has significant weaknesses in its reasoning, engagement with the literature, and analysis. The author needs to more deeply engage with concepts of racism beyond individual intent, clarify their understanding of \"material anchors,\" and more thoroughly analyze the examples they discuss."

         "I'll begin by analyzing this essay systematically according to the rubric criteria:\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nRelevant quotes:\n- \"In this essay, I argue that the company should adopt a causal fairness definition when designing its résumé-screening algorithm. Specifically, the company should aim to ensure that protected attributes like race, gender, and age do not directly cause disparities in candidates' chances of being selected.\"\n- \"Causal fairness directly addresses the core ethical concern: ensuring that protected attributes like race and gender do not causally influence hiring decisions.\"\n\nThe essay has a clearly stated thesis that directly answers the question about what definition of fairness the company should adopt. The student takes a decisive position advocating for causal fairness and provides a specific explanation of what this entails. The thesis is stated early in the introduction and reiterated in the conclusion.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Excellent**\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nRelevant quotes:\n- \"The issue with these definitions and approaches is they are unable to coexist. Beigang (2023) has argued that both definitions are mathematically incompatible when different groups have different base rates of success.\"\n- \"Under the causal approach, fairness requires that decisions are not influenced by irrelevant characteristics like race or gender. Thus, current statistical definitions of fairness fail to distinguish between disparities caused by bias and disparities caused by external factors.\"\n- \"Causal fairness criteria using matching techniques offers a more ethically sound and practically achievable approach.\"\n\nThe essay presents several premises that build toward the conclusion that causal fairness is the best definition for the company to adopt:\n1. Statistical fairness definitions like equalized odds and predictive parity are mathematically incompatible.\n2. This incompatibility exists because they focus on surface-level disparities rather than causation.\n3. A causal approach can reconcile these issues through matching techniques.\n4. Causal fairness better aligns with the ethical principle that hiring should be based on job-relevant qualifications.\n\nThe conclusion that the company should adopt causal fairness follows logically from these premises. The student explains the causal relationship between premises and conclusion.\n\nHowever, the normative premise that hiring should be based only on job-relevant qualifications could be more explicitly defended, though it is present. Some premises regarding the feasibility of implementing causal fairness are addressed in the objections section, but could be more thoroughly connected to the conclusion.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good**\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nRelevant quotes:\n- \"Equalized odds requires that error rates -- false positives and false negatives -- be equal across protected groups. Predictive parity requires that, for all selected candidates, the likelihood of actual success on the job is equal across groups.\"\n- \"Beigang (2023) has argued that both definitions are mathematically incompatible when different groups have different base rates of success.\"\n- \"The causal approach to fairness can be defined as focusing on whether a protected characteristic (race, gender, etc.) has a causal effect on errors or predictive value, beyond its relevance to the task at hand.\"\n\nThe essay demonstrates good understanding of the key concepts of fairness in ML, including equalized odds, predictive parity, and causal fairness. The student accurately summarizes these concepts in their own words. The student also refers to Beigang (2023) to support their points about the incompatibility of statistical fairness measures.\n\nI don't see any significant misinterpretations of the concepts discussed. The student avoids direct quotations and instead summarizes the ideas in their own words.\n\nOne limitation is that the essay could have included more references to the literature on algorithmic fairness beyond Beigang. This would demonstrate a broader understanding of the topic.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Good**\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nRelevant quotes:\n- \"Fairness in algorithmic decision-making refers to the just and equitable treatment of individuals or groups in the selection process. Many definitions of fairness exist, but two dominant statistical approaches have emerged: equalized odds and predictive parity.\"\n- \"Consider the résumé screening system the company wants to use for this example. Suppose two candidates, one male and one female, have identical degrees, work experience, and skills.\"\n- \"One objection for causal fairness is that it requires identifying and controlling for all relevant qualifications, which is practically impossible.\"\n\nThe essay has a clear structure with an introduction, sections defining and defending causal fairness, an example to illustrate the approach, consideration of objections, and a conclusion. The analysis breaks down the problem of fairness into appropriate parts:\n1. Defining different fairness metrics\n2. Explaining the causal approach\n3. Defending the causal approach ethically\n4. Providing an example for illustration\n5. Addressing potential objections\n\nThe essay provides an appropriate level of detail for each part, though some sections could be more developed. The example used to illustrate causal fairness is clear and relevant. The student also anticipates and responds to objections, showing deeper analysis.\n\nThe writing is generally clear and focused, with logical transitions between sections.\n\nPreliminary assessment: **Excellent**\n\n## Main Argument\n\nThe main argument of the essay is that companies using ML systems for resume screening should adopt a causal fairness definition rather than statistical fairness metrics like equalized odds or predictive parity. This is because:\n1. Statistical fairness metrics are mathematically incompatible when groups have different base rates.\n2. Causal fairness addresses the fundamental ethical concern that protected attributes should not directly influence hiring decisions.\n3. Causal fairness distinguishes between unfair discrimination and legitimate disparities caused by external factors.\n4. While imperfect, causal fairness offers the most principled and practical approach.\n\n## Supporting Points\n\n1. Statistical fairness definitions (equalized odds and predictive parity) cannot coexist mathematically when different groups have different base rates of success.\n2. The causal approach uses matching techniques to isolate the effect of protected characteristics on decisions.\n3. Causal fairness aligns with the ethical principle that hiring should be based on job-relevant qualifications rather than irrelevant personal attributes.\n4. The causal approach can help identify when disparities are due to bias versus when they reflect legitimate differences in qualifications.\n5. Even imperfect implementation of causal fairness can offer meaningful improvements over statistical fairness metrics.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\nThe argument that statistical fairness metrics are incompatible is well-supported by referencing Beigang (2023). However, the essay could have strengthened this point with additional scholarly references.\n\nThe claim that causal fairness better addresses the ethical concern about protected attributes influencing decisions is reasonable, but the normative premise that decisions should only be based on job-relevant factors could benefit from more explicit ethical justification.\n\nThe matching technique is described as a solution, but the essay acknowledges limitations in implementation. This shows nuanced thinking, but raises questions about whether the proposed approach is truly feasible.\n\nThe example provided effectively illustrates how causal fairness might work in practice, making the abstract concept more concrete and understandable.\n\nThe objections section shows critical thinking, acknowledging limitations of the causal approach while still defending it as the best option available. This strengthens the overall argument by showing the student has considered counterarguments.\n\n## Essay Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nThe essay has a clear structure with an introduction, body sections exploring different aspects of the argument, and a conclusion. Transitions between sections are generally smooth and logical.\n\nThe language is appropriately academic without being overly complex. Key terms are defined clearly.\n\nThe example about comparing male and female candidates with identical qualifications effectively illustrates the concept of causal fairness. This concrete example helps clarify the abstract concept.\n\nThe essay maintains focus on the question of what fairness definition the company should adopt, with each section contributing to answering this question.\n\n## How Well the Essay Addresses the Assigned Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the assigned question: \"What definition of fairness should the company take, and why?\" It provides a clear answer (causal fairness) and offers multiple reasons to support this choice. The essay considers alternative definitions of fairness (equalized odds and predictive parity) and explains why causal fairness is superior. It also considers practical implementation challenges, which is relevant to the company's decision-making process.\n\nOverall, the essay stays on-topic and provides a thoughtful, nuanced response to the assigned question.\n\nIn summary, this is a well-structured essay with a clear thesis that directly answers the question. The arguments are generally valid, though some premises could be more fully developed. The student demonstrates good understanding of the core concepts and breaks down the problem into appropriate parts for analysis. The use of examples helps illustrate abstract concepts, and the consideration of objections shows critical thinking. The essay could benefit from broader engagement with the literature and deeper ethical justification for some normative claims."

         "# 1. Thesis Analysis\n\nLooking for the thesis statement in the essay:\n\n> \"However, a closer examination of the processes behind such algorithms demonstrates that this apparent objectivity is an illusion, and that true objectivity is impossible.\"\n\nThis appears at the end of the introduction paragraph. It directly answers the question of whether data-driven tools for recidivism risk assessment are objective with a clear \"no\" position.\n\nIn the conclusion, the thesis is reinforced:\n\n> \"COMPAS is a tool praised by its supporters for its supposed ability to objectively predict recidivism risk in defendants. However, a closer examination calls this claim into question. The usage of a proxy variable that does not accurately represent the variable of interest (and expresses this failure in a racially discriminatory way) and a design process that, by necessity, relies on subjective value-based decision-making prevents the tool from being objective.\"\n\nPreliminary assessment for Thesis: **Excellent**. The thesis is clearly stated, answers the question decisively, and is consistent throughout the essay. The student takes a definitive position that these tools are not objective and explains why.\n\n# 2. Argument Validity Analysis\n\nMain argument structure:\n1. A tool can be objective if it does not involve subjective decision-making and human biases\n2. COMPAS involves subjective decisions and human bias at multiple points:\n   - In its definition of recidivism\n   - In the measurement of relevant characteristics\n   - In the selected interpretation of fairness\n3. Therefore, COMPAS is not objective\n\nKey normative premise: Objectivity requires freedom from subjective decision-making and human biases.\n\nSupporting quotes:\n> \"Opponents of the claim that COMPAS is objective agree with its proponents that a tool can be objective if it does not involve subjective decision-making and human biases.\"\n\n> \"There are several points at which subjective decisions were made and human bias bled into the model: its definition of recidivism, the measurement of relevant characteristics, and the selected interpretation of fairness.\"\n\n> \"Given that the selected proxy for recidivism is affected by human racial biases, that the training data was influenced by subjectivity at every step of its creation, and that the definition of fairness used when developing COMPAS was based on a subjective decision, the initial criteria for objectivity are not fulfilled.\"\n\nThe essay also presents potential counter-arguments and addresses them:\n> \"Supporters of COMPAS who view it as an objective tool might say that the biases incurred by the usage of arrests as a proxy for recidivism is not an attribute of the system itself, but rather an external societal factor.\"\n\nAnd provides a rebuttal:\n> \"I would respond to such criticisms by stating that the value of objectivity in prediction models is to allow the models to better reflect reality – a statement on which both sides are likely to agree. If, at any point of the process, bias and subjectivity dampen the model's ability to do this, then the model's objectivity has been damaged.\"\n\nPreliminary assessment for Argument Validity: **Excellent**. The premises are explicitly stated, the conclusion follows logically from these premises, and the student has addressed potential counter-arguments. The normative premise about what constitutes objectivity is present, and all key premises are connected to the conclusion.\n\n# 3. Understanding Analysis\n\nThe essay references several scholarly works and discussions about COMPAS and algorithmic fairness:\n\n> \"As described by Jacobs and Wallach. In the United States, 'False arrests' tend to disproportionately affect Black people.\"\n\n> \"As Hardt and Recht described, data about relevant characteristics – those given to the model for its training data – was gathered from defendants via surveys.\"\n\n> \"Barocas and Boyd contrast two perspectives on the algorithm's fairness: one from a critic who identifies a large discrepancy in error rates between Black and white defendants...\"\n\nThe student doesn't rely on direct quotes but instead summarizes the content in their own words. They demonstrate understanding of key concepts like:\n- Different definitions of fairness and their incompatibility\n- The use of proxy variables and their limitations\n- The role of bias in data collection and interpretation\n- The distinction between the tool itself and its implementation context\n\nPreliminary assessment for Understanding: **Good** to **Excellent**. The essay accurately summarizes referenced texts in the student's own words without apparent misinterpretations. The student integrates multiple sources effectively. However, it's not entirely clear which specific texts are being referenced as full citations are not provided (though this may be a format issue rather than an understanding issue).\n\n# 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity Analysis\n\nStructure:\nThe essay follows a clear structure:\n- Introduction with thesis\n- Argument against objectivity (brief overview)\n- Detailed breakdown of the argument with supporting evidence\n- Consideration of counter-arguments and rebuttals\n- Conclusion reiterating the thesis and its implications\n\nThe breakdown of the problem focuses on three key aspects:\n1. Definition of recidivism as a proxy variable\n2. Subjectivity in data collection and measurement\n3. Interpretation of fairness\n\nEach aspect is given appropriate attention:\n\n> \"Recidivism, as seen above, was defined as 'a new arrest within the next two years.'... a new arrest does not necessarily mean that a new crime has been committed... When the arrest data is used as a proxy for criminal behavior, the COMPAS tool overestimates the number of crimes committed by Black defendants compared to white defendants.\"\n\n> \"data about relevant characteristics... was gathered from defendants via surveys... there are two sources of subjective decisions. The first is the survey itself – ultimately, the question of what to include must be answered by value judgments. The second is from the responses...\"\n\n> \"Barocas and Boyd contrast two perspectives on the algorithm's fairness:... Both interpretations of fairness are commonly accepted as valid. However... it has been demonstrated that the two are mutually exclusive. Deciding which interpretation to use is thus a subjective value judgment.\"\n\nThe analysis is focused and balanced, with appropriate detail for the word limit.\n\nClarity:\nThe essay uses clear language to explain complex concepts like different definitions of fairness. For example:\n\n> \"To make these statements clearer the critics have noticed that among defendants who did not reoffend, Black defendants were twice as likely to have been assigned a high recidivism risk than white defendants. Northpointe, on the other hand, stated that among defendants assigned a high recidivism risk, an equal amount of Black and white defendants did reoffend.\"\n\nPreliminary assessment for Analysis, Structure, and Clarity: **Excellent**. The essay breaks down the problem into suitable parts, provides appropriate detail, maintains focus throughout, and presents a clear and logical structure.\n\n# Main Argument and Supporting Points\n\nMain Argument: Data-driven recidivism risk assessment tools like COMPAS are not objective because they involve subjective decisions and human biases at multiple points in their design and implementation.\n\nSupporting Points:\n1. The definition of recidivism as \"a new arrest within two years\" introduces racial bias due to discriminatory policing practices\n2. The data collection process involves subjective decisions about what to measure and relies on potentially inaccurate self-reporting\n3. The choice between different valid but mutually exclusive interpretations of fairness requires a subjective value judgment\n4. The claimed objectivity of these tools obscures their reinforcement of existing societal biases\n5. True objectivity in such tools is fundamentally impossible due to necessary subjective decisions in their design\n\n# Critical Examination of Argument Validity\n\nThe argument is logically valid. If we accept the premise that objectivity requires freedom from subjective decision-making and human biases, and the student provides evidence that COMPAS involves both, then the conclusion that COMPAS is not objective follows necessarily.\n\nThe student's handling of potential counter-arguments strengthens the overall argument. By acknowledging that some might argue that biases are external to the system itself, the student demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the topic. The rebuttal effectively demonstrates why this counter-argument fails by connecting the value of objectivity to reflecting reality accurately.\n\nThe discussion of mutually exclusive fairness definitions is particularly strong, as it shows that subjective choices are unavoidable even with the best intentions.\n\n# Assessment of Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\nStructure: The essay has a clear and logical structure that guides the reader through the argument. The introduction sets up the question and thesis, the body develops the argument with specific points, and the conclusion restates the thesis and adds implications.\n\nLanguage: The language is precise and academic without being overly technical. Complex concepts are explained clearly.\n\nExamples: The essay uses specific examples effectively, particularly in explaining the different interpretations of fairness and how arrest data can be biased. For instance, the explanation of how COMPAS can be simultaneously \"fair\" in one sense (equal accuracy across groups) while \"unfair\" in another sense (different error rates) clearly illustrates the subjective choices involved.\n\nFocus: The essay stays focused on answering the question about objectivity throughout. Each paragraph contributes directly to the main argument.\n\n# Addressing the Assigned Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the assigned question: \"Data-driven tools for recidivism risk assessment operationalize recidivism as 'a new arrest within two years.' Proponents of such tools claim that such risk assessment tools are objective. Are they?\"\n\nThe student:\n1. Clearly states their position (these tools are not objective)\n2. Addresses the specific operationalization mentioned in the question (recidivism as \"a new arrest within two years\")\n3. Engages with proponents' claims of objectivity\n4. Provides a thorough analysis of why objectivity fails in this context\n\nThe essay stays focused on this question throughout and provides a well-reasoned answer backed by evidence and analysis.\n\n# Overall Analysis Summary\n\nThe essay demonstrates excellent work across all rubric criteria:\n\n1. Thesis: The thesis is clear, directly answers the question, and takes a decisive position.\n2. Argument Validity: The argument is valid, with explicit premises that logically lead to the conclusion. Counter-arguments are addressed effectively.\n3. Understanding: The essay shows good understanding of the relevant concepts and literature, summarized in the student's own words.\n4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity: The problem is broken down appropriately, with focused analysis of each component and clear, logical structure.\n\nThe essay effectively uses the available word count to develop a thorough argument without sacrificing depth or clarity. It directly addresses the assigned question and provides a well-reasoned, evidence-based answer.\n\nMinor weaknesses:\n- Some references could be more specific or better integrated\n- The discussion of data collection via surveys could be more detailed\n- The essay could further explore the practical implications of its conclusion\n\nBut these are minor issues in an otherwise excellent essay."

However, the specifics of which fairness definitions should be used at which stages could have been incorporated into the thesis statement itself, rather than leaving these details for later elaboration.",
         "Argument Validity: The essay explicitly states four premises before reaching its conclusion:\n1. Fairness methods are context-dependent tools with strengths and weaknesses\n2. Equalised odds and predictive parity are incompatible due to the Impossibility Theorem\n3. Causal matching isn't viable with resume data alone\n4. ATS pipeline stages have different contextual requirements\n\nThe conclusion follows logically from these premises, and the student develops each premise before connecting them to the conclusion. However, there are issues with the mathematical equations (they appear incomplete with placeholders like \"appears like this:\") and unexplained notations (e.g., \"y.\" appears several times). Additionally, some assertions, particularly regarding why predictive parity is better for later stages, could use stronger justification.\n\nExample of logical connection: \"At earlier stages of the process, ensuring the algorithm does not favour one group over another based on error rates alone is crucial (equalised odds)... In later stages, predictive parity is the more suitable as a metric of fairness.\"",
         "Understanding: The essay demonstrates solid understanding of key algorithmic fairness concepts:\n\"For separation, we use 'equalised odds' (EO) to create a situation where each group has the same error rates, such that both the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) are equal across groups.\"\n\n\"From this result, we observe the Kleinberg–Chouldekova Impossibility Theorem in action – for both equalised odds and predictive parity to hold, the base rates must be equal.\"\n\nThe student accurately references relevant literature: \"The taxonomy provided by Kleinberg et al., Barocas et al., and Beigang allows us to focus on their practical application for this situation.\"\n\nHowever, the mathematical formulations seem to have formatting or copy-paste errors, and some concepts could be explained more clearly or with concrete examples.",
         "Analysis, Structure, and Clarity: The essay follows a logical structure with premises leading to a conclusion, followed by detailed analysis. The problem is broken down appropriately:\n- Different fairness methods and their strengths/weaknesses\n- The impossibility theorem and its implications\n- Analysis of different ATS pipeline stages\n- Potential issues with the approach\n\nHowever, the analysis is somewhat imbalanced - considerable space is devoted to explaining concepts rather than analyzing their application. The essay would benefit from more concrete examples of how the proposed approach would work in practice. The conclusion feels abrupt with potential issues mentioned but not fully explored:\n\n\"Chief among them is the potential for imbalance, wherein one method takes precedence over the other. For example, using two methods (which perform different on the metric of accuracy) may 'cancel out' the perceived benefit of trying to increase selection accuracy with predictive parity.\"",

Thesis\n\nThe thesis of the essay appears to be:\n> \"Argument: The firm should define \"fair\" based on the stage of the ATS pipeline.\"\n\nThis is explicitly stated after the premises are laid out. It answers the question about how a firm should use ML and NLP for resume screening in a way that is fair. The thesis is relatively clear, though it could be more specific about what fairness definitions should be used at which stages (this is actually addressed later in the essay).\n\nRelated quotes:\n- \"The firm should define \"fair\" based on the stage of the ATS pipeline.\"\n- \"The definition of fairness employed by the hiring team depends on the group being judged, which directly correlates to early and late stages of the ATS pipeline.\"\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good. The thesis is present and answers the question, but could be more explicitly stated in terms of exactly what fairness definitions should be used at which stages (although this is elaborated later in the essay).\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nThe essay sets up a formal argument structure with premises followed by a conclusion:\n\n**Premises:**\n1. \"Methods of defining and achieving fairness are tools – they have strengths and weaknesses. The two main methods (equalised odds, predictive parity) are considered \"fair\" in respect to the context in which they are applied.\"\n2. \"Due to the Kleinberg–Chouldekova Impossibility Theorem, equalised odds and predictive parity are not compatible given differing base rates among groups.\"\n3. \"While causal matching presents an interesting mitigation to the Kleinberg–Chouldekova Impossibility Theorem, resumes alone often do not provide enough information to identify structured and actionable causal variables.\"\n4. \"ATS uses a pipeline whose stages have different contextual requirements that affect which fairness definition is most appropriate.\"\n\n**Conclusion:** \"The firm should define \"fair\" based on the stage of the ATS pipeline.\"\n\nThe conclusion does follow logically from the premises. If fairness methods have different strengths in different contexts (P1), they cannot be used simultaneously due to the impossibility theorem (P2), causal matching isn't viable with resume data (P3), and ATS has different stages with different requirements (P4), then it makes sense to vary the definition of fairness based on pipeline stage.\n\nThe essay elaborates on each premise and makes a case for using equalised odds at early stages and predictive parity at later stages:\n\n> \"At earlier stages of the process, ensuring the algorithm does not favour one group over the other based on error rates alone is crucial (equalised odds).\"\n\n> \"In later stages, predictive parity is the more suitable as a metric of fairness.\"\n\nThe argument is mostly valid, though there are some issues:\n- The essay mentions mathematical formulas but doesn't include them properly (there are placeholders like \"appears like this:\")\n- Some statements are made without sufficient justification, such as why predictive parity is more suitable for later stages\n- The essay mentions \"y.\" in several places, which seems to be an editing error\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good. Most premises are explicit and the conclusion follows, but there are some gaps in the reasoning and formatting issues that affect clarity.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nThe essay demonstrates understanding of key concepts in algorithmic fairness:\n- Equalised odds and predictive parity\n- The Kleinberg-Chouldekova Impossibility Theorem\n- Causal matching as proposed by Beigang\n- The challenges of using ML/NLP in hiring contexts\n\nThe student demonstrates familiarity with the work of relevant authors:\n> \"The taxonomy provided by Kleinberg et al., Barocas et al., and Beigang allows us to focus on their practical application for this situation.\"\n\nHowever, there are some issues:\n- The essay attempts to present mathematical formulations but appears to have formatting or copy-paste errors\n- Some concepts could be explained more clearly\n- There are instances where the relationship between concepts is asserted rather than explained\n\nExamples of understanding:\n> \"For separation, we use \"equalised odds\" (EO) to create a situation where each group has the same error rates, such that both the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) are equal across groups.\"\n\n> \"For sufficiency, predictive parity (PP) is established by observing the positive predictive value (PPV) across groups.\"\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good to Needs Improvement. The student demonstrates understanding of the concepts but has some issues with presentation and there are places where more explanation would be beneficial.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nThe essay has a clear structure:\n1. Introduction to the problem\n2. Presentation of premises\n3. Statement of argument\n4. Explanation of fairness methods\n5. Discussion of the impossibility theorem\n6. Consideration of causal matching\n7. Analysis of different stages of the ATS pipeline\n8. Discussion of potential issues with the approach\n\nThe breakdown of the problem seems reasonable, but there are some issues with the analysis:\n- The essay spends considerable time explaining concepts but less time analyzing their application\n- The analysis of why different fairness definitions are appropriate at different stages could be more thorough\n- The conclusion feels somewhat abrupt, with potential issues mentioned but not fully explored\n\nNotable quotes:\n> \"Each stage has different contextual requirements that affect which fairness definition is most appropriate, given that ML and NLP are used.\"\n\n> \"Chief among them is the potential for imbalance, wherein one method takes precedence over the other.\"\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good to Needs Improvement. The essay has a reasonable structure but the analysis is somewhat imbalanced and some parts could be developed more thoroughly.\n\n## Main Argument and Supporting Points\n\n**Main Argument:** The firm should use different definitions of fairness at different stages of the applicant tracking system pipeline, specifically equalised odds at early stages and predictive parity at later stages.\n\n**Supporting Points:**\n1. Different fairness methods (equalised odds and predictive parity) have different strengths and weaknesses in different contexts.\n2. These methods cannot be used simultaneously due to the Kleinberg-Chouldekova Impossibility Theorem.\n3. Early stages of hiring involve the general population, where equalised odds helps prevent systemic discrimination.\n4. Later stages involve a more filtered pool where predictive parity is more appropriate.\n5. This approach balances the need for fairness across different groups with the practical requirements of hiring.\n\n## Critical Examination of Arguments\n\n1. **The impossibility theorem argument** is technically sound, as it is a well-established result in algorithmic fairness literature. However, the essay has formatting issues when trying to present the mathematical proof.\n\n2. **The rejection of causal matching** is reasonable given the limited information in resumes, but the essay could provide more support for this claim.\n\n3. **The argument for stage-based fairness** is logical but could be supported with more concrete examples or evidence of how this would work in practice.\n\n4. **The discussion of drawbacks** is appropriate but somewhat superficial. It mentions issues like imbalance and structural challenges without exploring solutions in depth.\n\n## Structure, Language, Examples, and Focus\n\n**Structure:** The essay has a clear logical flow with premises leading to a conclusion. However, the structure could be improved by having clearer section transitions and a more comprehensive conclusion.\n\n**Language:** The writing is generally clear but there are some oddities (like \"y.\" appearing multiple times) and some sentences are overly complex.\n\n**Examples:** The essay is light on concrete examples. It discusses theoretical concepts well but doesn't illustrate how they would apply in specific hiring scenarios.\n\n**Focus:** The essay maintains focus on the question of fairness in automated resume screening, but some sections (like the mathematical explanations) could be condensed to allow for deeper analysis of the practical implications.\n\n## Addressing the Question\n\nThe essay directly addresses the question of how a firm should use ML and NLP for fair resume screening. It provides a specific recommendation (different fairness definitions at different pipeline stages) and discusses potential challenges.\n\nHowever, the essay could more directly address what constitutes \"happy\" and \"successful\" employees and how fairness relates to these outcomes. It also doesn't fully explore how its recommendation would be implemented in practice.\n\nOVERALL ANALYSIS:\n\nThe essay demonstrates good understanding of algorithmic fairness concepts and presents a logical argument for a stage-based approach to fairness in automated hiring. The structure is clear and the thesis addresses the question.\n\nHowever, there are several issues that detract from the essay's quality:\n1. Formatting problems with mathematical formulas\n2. Occasional unclear language and unexplained \"y.\" notations\n3. Limited use of concrete examples\n4. Some assertions that would benefit from more justification\n5. Imbalanced analysis that focuses more on explaining concepts than analyzing their application\n\nThe argument is generally valid but would be strengthened by addressing these issues and providing more concrete implementation details."

         "## Overall Initial Reading\nFirst, I want to read through the entire essay to get a general sense of its quality, structure, and arguments before diving into specific criteria.\n\nThe essay addresses the question of what definition of fairness a company should take when using Machine Learning to screen résumés. The student argues for \"counterfactual fairness\" as the guiding principle. The essay discusses how biases in data can perpetuate historical injustices, refers to course materials (Benjamin 2019 and Johnson 2020), and argues that fairness requires more than algorithmic adjustments.\n\nLet me identify the main argument and supporting points:\n\nMain argument: Companies should adopt counterfactual fairness as their definition of fairness for ML hiring systems, which ensures applicants are evaluated without the influence of systematic biases embedded in historical hiring practices.\n\nSupporting points:\n1. ML systems learn from flawed human decisions and historical injustices\n2. Proxy attributes can serve as replacements for protected variables like race and gender\n3. True fairness requires dismantling structures that allow discrimination to persist\n4. Counterfactual fairness should be implemented at multiple levels beyond the algorithm\n5. The \"accuracy vs. fairness\" tradeoff is a myth based on a narrow definition of accuracy\n\nNow I'll analyze the essay according to each rubric criterion:\n\n## 1. Thesis\n\nKey sentences related to thesis:\n- \"In this essay, I argue that counterfactual fairness should be the guiding principle in the design of machine learning based hiring systems.\"\n- \"A company should adopt a definition of fairness that is grounded in counterfactual fairness, which ensures applicants are carefully evaluated without the influence of systematic biases embedded in historical hiring practices.\"\n- \"As a woman of color, I am deeply aware of how bias and racism manifest in algorithmic systems, in which I argue that fairness cannot be achieved through mathematical adjustments alone.\"\n\nThe thesis is clearly stated in the introduction. The student takes a decisive position that counterfactual fairness should be the guiding principle in ML hiring systems. The student also explains what this means - ensuring applicants are evaluated without systematic biases. The thesis directly answers the question posed about what definition of fairness the company should take.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Excellent. The thesis is clearly stated and answers the question decisively.\n\n## 2. Argument Validity\n\nKey passages related to argument validity:\n- \"As we discussed in the lecture, counterfactual fairness ensures that individuals are treated the same regardless of socially sensitive attributes.\"\n- \"The 'garbage in, garbage out' issue refers to how biased training data leads to biased algorithmic outcomes. If a hiring model or system is trained on historical data that reflects discrimination, like a previously favored hiring group or cohort, then the model will inevitably replicate or amplify those biases.\"\n- \"A company should ensure that they redefine hiring success in a way that prioritizes both competency and overall equity.\"\n\nThe student presents a normative premise (that fairness should ensure individuals are treated the same regardless of sensitive attributes) and factual premises (ML systems learn from historical data that contains biases; the \"garbage in, garbage out\" problem). The conclusion that companies should adopt counterfactual fairness follows from these premises.\n\nHowever, there are some gaps in the argument. The student doesn't fully explain what counterfactual fairness means in technical terms, and the connection between premises and conclusion could be stronger. Some premises are implicit rather than explicitly stated. The essay mentions that \"counterfactual fairness is an overly complex topic\" but doesn't fully unpack this complexity.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good. Most premises are explicit, but some minor premises are missing. The normative premise is present, and premises are connected to the conclusion, though the connection could be strengthened.\n\n## 3. Understanding\n\nKey passages related to understanding:\n- \"The New Jim Code is no more than a sly way in which apparent neutral technologies encode and perpetuate racial hierarchies.\"\n- \"Johnson (2020) mentions the concept of how algorithmic biases have arisen from proxy attributes.\"\n- \"As mentioned by Johnson (2020), there is no purely algorithmic fix to bias.\"\n\nThe student demonstrates understanding of the course materials by referencing Benjamin (2019) and Johnson (2020). They accurately summarize key concepts like the \"New Jim Code\" and proxy attributes. The essay shows understanding of counterfactual fairness, though it could be explained more thoroughly.\n\nHowever, there are some minor misunderstandings or imprecisions. For example, the student refers to \"gatekeeping mechanisms\" in a way that seems tangential to the main argument. Some concepts could be explained more clearly and precisely.\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good. References to texts are generally accurate, with some minor misunderstandings or imprecisions. The student summarizes in their own words rather than relying heavily on quotes.\n\n## 4. Analysis, Structure, and Clarity\n\nKey passages related to analysis, structure, and clarity:\n- Section headings: \"Defining Fairness in Hiring Algorithms,\" \"The Inescapable Reality of Bias in Algorithmic Hiring,\" \"Implementing Fairness Beyond the Algorithm,\" \"Confronting the Tradeoff Myth and Ethical Responsibilities,\" \"The Call for Justice-Oriented Hiring\"\n- \"The responsibility to ensure fairness does not end with algorithmic adjustments. Companies must ensure that their hiring teams are trained in recognizing and mitigating bias, utilize transparent decision-making processes, and artificial intelligence systems should be required to be continuously audited.\"\n- \"While adopting counterfactual fairness is an essential first step, it is not enough on its own.\"\n\nThe essay has a clear structure with section headings that break down the problem into suitable parts. It moves from defining the problem, to explaining the concept of counterfactual fairness, to discussing implementation beyond algorithms, to addressing counterarguments, and finally to a call for action.\n\nThe analysis is generally focused, though some sections (like the discussion of gatekeeping) could be more relevant. The level of detail is appropriate in some areas but lacking in others - for instance, the technical definition of counterfactual fairness could be more detailed.\n\nThere are some minor clarity issues. For example, the sentence \"The impact of a company incorporating a beneficial definition of fairness is often overlooked or questioned rather than thoroughly explained\" is somewhat vague. There are also a few typos and grammatical errors that affect clarity (e.g., \"p positions,\" \"these inequalities\" without clear referent).\n\nPreliminary assessment: Good. The essay has a reasonable breakdown of the problem and generally good structure, though some parts are analyzed more thoroughly than others.\n\n## Additional Considerations:\n\nWord limit: The essay appears to be within or close to the 1500-word limit.\n\nUse of examples: The essay includes some examples, such as how AI systems might discriminate against Black women in leadership roles, but could benefit from more concrete examples of counterfactual fairness in practice.\n\nLanguage: The language is generally clear but sometimes imprecise or contains typos that affect clarity.\n\nFocus: The essay maintains a good focus on the question of defining fairness in ML hiring systems, though it occasionally veers into related but less central topics.\n\nDirect answer to the question: The essay directly answers the question by clearly advocating for counterfactual fairness as the definition a company should take.\n\nNow that I've analyzed each criterion, I can proceed with the formal evaluation."
