- **Excellent**: Clearly stated thesis that answers the question decisively; directly answers the essay question.
- **Good**: Thesis present but could be more explicitly stated or isn't fully decisive.
- **Needs Improvement**: Thesis is vague or avoids taking a clear position; thesis is not a direct answer to the essay question.
- **Unacceptable**: No discernible thesis or thesis merely restates that "more discussion is needed"; thesis is not a direct answer to the essay question.

## 2. Argument Validity
- **Excellent**: All premises explicitly stated; conclusion follows logically from premises; no fallacies; correct use of necessary and sufficient conditions; all premises fully and obviously connected to conclusion.
- **Good**: Most premises explicit; one or more minor premise missing but key normative premise present; premises still obviously connected to conclusion; correct use of necessary and sufficient conditions.
- **Needs Improvement**: Premises explicit but several premises missing or at least one major normative premise missing; somewhat unclear connection between premises and conclusion; contains one or more logical fallacies; incorrect use of logical indicator words (e.g., "therefore", "thus", "hence", "so") or incorrect use of necessary and sufficient conditions.
- **Unacceptable**: Few or no explicit premises; conclusion does not follow from stated premises.

## 3. Understanding 
- **Excellent**: Referenced texts accurately summarized in student's own words; no misinterpretations; key concepts and terms are explicitly defined.

- **Excellent**: Problem broken down into suitable parts; explicit statement of topic or clarification of essay question; essay concentrates on one narrow line of argument in support of essay's main thesis, acknowledging other supporting considerations but setting them aside.
- **Good**: Reasonable breakdown of problem; some clarification on main topic or interpretation of essay question; essay concentrates on one narrow line of argument.

General notes
- On references and further literature: Literature engagement is not a desiderata for this essay! Students do not need to give explicit references or engage with or draw on further literature. It is sufficient and desireable for a student to build entirely on their own thought.
- On typos: Unless typos are glaring, do not point them out. Also remember that an essay may have been converted from PDF. Ignore typos and artifacts in the text that may have resulted from this conversion.
